## Composition — 7 Elements Max

Isometric view of a heavy-duty mechanic's toolbox, lid open, with tools spilling out in organized display. Professional abundance — not chaos.

**Element 1 — Toolbox Body:**
Classic metal mechanic's toolbox. Dark Gray body. Isometric view facing viewer. Corner reinforcements and latches in Rust Orange. Rivets along edges (Light Gray circles). Lid propped open at 90°. Sturdy, professional, well-maintained.

**Element 2 — Plunger (Signature Tool):**
Industrial plunger leaning against the toolbox. Light Gray wooden handle. Rust Orange rubber cup. Prominent placement — callback to "Funnel Plumber" identity.

**Element 3 — Wrenches (2):**
Two adjustable wrenches of different sizes. Light Gray metal. Lying across the top of the toolbox, handles hanging over the edge. Classic rubber hose proportions — slightly curved handles.

**Element 4 — Pressure Gauge:**
Handheld pressure gauge sitting on top. Vintage Cream face. Dark Gray housing. Needle pointing to ROI Green safe zone. Color zones only — no numbers.

**Element 5 — Magnifying Glass:**
Diagnostic magnifying glass partially visible among tools. Light Gray handle. Clear lens with white edge highlight.

**Element 6 — Rolled Blueprints (2):**
Vintage Cream paper rolls partially unrolled and spilling from the box. Tied with Rust Orange bands. Simple line patterns on visible edges suggesting technical diagrams — no readable text.

**Element 7 — Pipe Segments (2-3 small):**
Clean Light Gray pipe pieces among the tools. Represent replacement parts. Professional quality — clean cuts, visible flanges.
