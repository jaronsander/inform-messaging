# Data Debt Tangled Pipes
**Asset Type:** Problem Section Illustration
**Usage:** Homepage "Data Debt is Compounding" section
**Priority:** HIGH

---

## Style Specification

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading, no photorealism
- Chaotic but readable composition
- No text, no labels, no numbers on the image
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Pipe bodies: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Corrosion / leaks / decay: Rust Orange (#D35400) — dominant color
- Trapped value trying to flow: ROI Green (#39FF14) — minimal
- Patches / highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

## Composition — 7 Elements Max

A tangled mass of pipes showing accumulated data debt. Overwhelming but readable. This is pure problem — no solutions visible.

**Element 1 — Tangled Pipe Cluster (Center):**
4-5 pipes of varying sizes twisted and knotted together. Classic rubber hose flexibility with exaggerated bends. Pipes loop and cross each other. Dark Gray base material with heavy Rust Orange corrosion spreading across surfaces.

**Element 2 — Duct Tape Patches:**
3-4 visible patches wrapped around pipe sections. Vintage Cream tape with Rust Orange stains bleeding through. Patches layered on each other (repeated "fixes"). Some peeling or failing. No text on patches.

**Element 3 — Active Leaks:**
3-4 leak points dripping Rust Orange liquid. Classic cartoon teardrop drips. Small puddle shapes forming below. Bold, heavy drip shapes.

**Element 4 — Blocked Flow:**
Small amounts of ROI Green liquid visible behind a Rust Orange clog inside one pipe. Pressure bulging at the blocked section. Shows what value is being lost.

**Element 5 — Failing Pressure Gauge:**
Single gauge attached to the tangle. Cracked Vintage Cream face. Needle pinned at maximum in the Rust Orange danger zone. Color zones only — no numbers, no text.

**Element 6 — Corrosion Detail:**
Rust Orange patches and pitting visible on pipe surfaces. Darkening around joints and connections. Flaking suggested with simple shapes.

**Element 7 — Failed Connection:**
One visible junction with misaligned flanges. Missing bolts. Rust Orange staining around the joint. Drip forming beneath.

## Color Distribution

- Rust Orange (#D35400): 60% — dominant problem indicator
- Dark Gray (#3A3A3A): 20% — base pipe material
- Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC): 10% — patches, gauge face
- ROI Green (#39FF14): 5% — trapped value (creates contrast/urgency)
- Black (#000000): 5% — outlines

## Rubber Hose Style Notes

- Pipes have classic rubber hose flexibility — exaggerated bends, not rigid
- Knots are visually interesting (not just crossed lines)
- Drips have personality (teardrop shapes, bold weight)
- Gauge face has a round, readable quality
- Patches look desperate and failing
- Everything readable at thumbnail size — no fine detail

## Visual Purpose

**Paired With:** "Your Data Debt is Compounding Daily"

The visual makes the abstract concept of data debt feel tangible, physical, and urgent. Viewer should feel: "This is bad. This needs immediate attention. This is only getting worse."
