# Tier 2: Before/After Pipeline Transformation
**Asset Type:** Service Tier Illustration
**Usage:** Services page — Tier 2 (Pipeline Re-Architecture)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

---

## Style Specification

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading
- Split composition (before / after)
- No text, no labels, no numbers
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Clean pipe material: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Decay / problems: Rust Orange (#D35400)
- Success / healthy flow: ROI Green (#39FF14)
- Structural depth: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

## Composition — 6 Elements Max

Vertical split showing before (left) and after (right) with a wrench at the center as the transformation agent. Color tells the story: Rust Orange → ROI Green.

**Element 1 — Before Pipes (Left Side):**
2-3 pipes tangled and kinked. Dark Gray base with heavy Rust Orange corrosion. One visible duct tape patch (Vintage Cream with Rust Orange staining). A Rust Orange drip falling from a crack. Chaotic, inefficient routing.

**Element 2 — After Pipes (Right Side):**
2-3 pipes cleanly organized and straight. Light Gray clean material. ROI Green liquid flowing smoothly inside (visible through a cutaway or transparent section). Professional flange connections with tight bolts.

**Element 3 — Wrench (Center, Hero Element):**
Large cartoon adjustable wrench positioned at the boundary between before and after. Light Gray metal with Vintage Cream highlights. Jaws gripping the connection point where the transformation happens. 2-3 bold black motion arcs around the wrench head.

**Element 4 — Transformation Sparks:**
Small ROI Green energy bursts at the wrench contact point. 3-4 small star/sparkle shapes. Shows active work happening at the transition.

**Element 5 — Before Gauge (Left):**
Small pressure gauge on the before side. Cracked face. Needle in Rust Orange danger zone. Color zones only — no numbers.

**Element 6 — After Gauge (Right):**
Small pressure gauge on the after side. Clean face. Needle in ROI Green safe zone. Color zones only — no numbers.

## Visual Purpose

**Paired With:** "Moving complex logic out of brittle UI builders into robust systems."

Communicates: We don't patch — we rebuild properly. Dramatic, visible improvement from failing to thriving.
