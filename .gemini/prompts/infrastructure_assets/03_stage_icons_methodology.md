**Asset Type:** Modular Icon Set (3 icons)
**Usage:** Homepage solution section, repeated across site
**Priority:** HIGH — used in multiple locations

## Style Specification (All 3 Icons)

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of each subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading
- Simple, bold, readable at 80px x 80px thumbnail
- No text, no labels, no numbers on any icon
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Tools / infrastructure: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Success / healthy: ROI Green (#39FF14)
- Problems / warnings: Rust Orange (#D35400)
- Gauge faces / highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

**Technical Specs:**
- Dimensions: 800px x 800px (square) per icon
- File Format: PNG with transparent background
- Resolution: 300 DPI
- Line Weight: 3-4px black outlines
- White Border: 8-10px

## Icon 1: Detection — Magnifying Glass + Pipe

**Concept:** Diagnostic examination of infrastructure

**3 Elements Only:**

1. **Magnifying Glass (Primary):** Large cartoon magnifying glass. Light Gray handle, bold black lens frame. Oversized lens. Friendly rounded proportions.

2. **Pipe Cross-Section (Under Lens):** Short horizontal pipe segment visible through/beneath the lens. Interior revealed showing Rust Orange blockage material with ROI Green particles trapped behind it.

3. **Scan Indicator:** Subtle ROI Green glow inside the lens area where it overlaps the pipe — implying active scanning.

**Color Distribution:**
- 35% Light Gray (magnifying glass, pipe exterior)
- 30% Rust Orange (blockage inside pipe)
- 25% ROI Green (trapped particles, scan glow)
- 10% Vintage Cream (lens highlight)

## Icon 2: Implementation — Wrench + Pipe Connection

**Concept:** Fixing infrastructure connections

**3 Elements Only:**

1. **Wrench (Primary):** Large cartoon adjustable wrench. Light Gray metal. Positioned at an angle, gripping a hexagonal bolt at a pipe connection. Classic rubber hose proportions — oversized jaw, slightly curved handle.

2. **Pipe Connection:** Two pipe segments meeting at a flange. Left side shows Rust Orange staining (the problem being fixed). Right side shows clean Light Gray with ROI Green glow (the fix taking hold).

3. **Motion Lines:** 2-3 bold black motion arcs around the wrench head showing active turning.

**Color Distribution:**
- 40% Light Gray (wrench, pipe segments)
- 30% ROI Green (fixed side glow)
- 20% Rust Orange (problem side staining)
- 10% Black (motion lines, outlines)

## Icon 3: Monitoring — Single Pressure Gauge

**Concept:** Continuous system health monitoring

**3 Elements Only:**

1. **Pressure Gauge (Primary):** Single large circular pressure gauge. Dark Gray housing/rim. Vintage Cream face. Color zones only — Rust Orange section (left/danger) and ROI Green section (right/safe). Needle pointing firmly into the ROI Green safe zone. No numbers, no tick marks, no text.

2. **Indicator Light:** Single small ROI Green circle below the gauge — a status LED showing "system healthy."

3. **Pipe Context:** Small pipe stub connecting gauge to a short pipe segment beneath — showing what the gauge is monitoring. ROI Green glow inside the pipe indicating healthy flow.

**Color Distribution:**
- 40% Vintage Cream (gauge face)
- 30% ROI Green (safe zone, needle, indicator, pipe glow)
- 20% Dark Gray (gauge housing)
- 10% Rust Orange (danger zone section)

## Set Cohesion

**Visual Consistency:**
- Same line weight, border width, and element sizing across all 3
- Balanced color distribution — no icon overwhelmingly one color
- Same level of detail (all simple, all bold)

**Color Story Across Set:**
- Icon 1: Mix of Rust Orange (problem) and ROI Green (hidden value)
- Icon 2: Transformation from Rust Orange to ROI Green
- Icon 3: Dominant ROI Green (healthy maintained state)

**Progression:** Discovery → Transformation → Maintenance

## Testing

**Thumbnail Test (80px x 80px):** Main element (magnifying glass, wrench, gauge) must be immediately identifiable.

**Mobile Test (375px for all 3 side-by-side):** Equal visual weight, clear rhythm, distinct from each other.

**Grayscale Test:** Still distinguishable by shape alone.
