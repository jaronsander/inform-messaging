## Style Specification

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading, no photorealism
- Isometric perspective (30° angle)
- No text, no labels, no numbers on the image
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Pipe bodies: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Healthy flow / success: ROI Green (#39FF14)
- Problems / leaks / corrosion: Rust Orange (#D35400)
- Structural depth: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Gauge faces / highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

## Composition — 6 Elements Max

An isometric cutaway of an interconnected pipe system. Organized engineering, not spaghetti. The system shows both healthy and failing infrastructure in one view.

**Element 1 — Main Horizontal Pipe:**
Large pipe running left to right. Light Gray body. Cutaway section reveals ROI Green liquid flowing smoothly through the interior. Clean flanges with visible bolts.

**Element 2 — Healthy Junction (Lower-Left):**
Single valve connection point. Classic industrial wheel-style valve. ROI Green glow around the connection indicating proper seal. Clean, tight bolts.

**Element 3 — Problem Branch (Upper-Right):**
Smaller branch pipe showing deterioration. Rust Orange corrosion patches on exterior. A visible kink showing stress. One or two Rust Orange drips falling from a crack.

**Element 4 — Healthy Pressure Gauge:**
Attached to the main pipe near the healthy junction. Circular face in Vintage Cream. Color zones only — Rust Orange (left/danger), ROI Green (right/safe). Needle pointing to the green zone. No numbers, no tick marks, no text.

**Element 5 — Failing Pressure Gauge:**
Attached near the problem branch. Same style as Element 4 but with a cracked face (diagonal crack line). Needle pinned in the Rust Orange danger zone.

**Element 6 — Flow Indicators:**
Simple ROI Green droplet shapes inside the cutaway section showing movement direction. Stagnant Rust Orange particles visible near the problem branch. No arrows, no text — use particle direction and spacing to imply flow.

## Rubber Hose Style Notes

- Pipes have slight flexibility (not perfectly rigid)
- Rounded corners and edges throughout
- Bolts and valves have exaggerated cartoon proportions
- Flowing liquid has classic 1930s cartoon bounce (teardrop shapes)
- Gauge faces have a friendly, round quality
- Drips are bold teardrop shapes with personality

## Technical Specifications

- Dimensions: 2000px x 2000px (square)
- File Format: PNG with transparent background
- Resolution: 300 DPI
- White border included in the asset file

**Readability Test:**
At 375px mobile width, all major elements must be identifiable:
- Main pipe flow visible
- Leak drips visible
- Gauge readings distinguishable by color
- Green = healthy, Orange = problem

## Visual Hierarchy

1. Eye drawn to ROI Green flow first (success/solution)
2. Then notices Rust Orange problem areas (urgency)
3. Understands the system complexity (authority)

**Paired With Headline:** "Your RevOps Funnel Plumbers"

The visual communicates: We understand complex systems, we spot problems, we fix infrastructure.
