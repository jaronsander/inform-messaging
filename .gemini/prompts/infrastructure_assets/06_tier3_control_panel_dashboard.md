**Asset Type:** Service Tier Illustration
**Usage:** Services page — Tier 3 (Flow Assurance & Telemetry)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

## Style Specification

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading
- No text, no labels, no numbers, no screen readouts
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Panel body: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Gauge faces: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Healthy indicators: ROI Green (#39FF14) — dominant
- Pipe material: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

## Composition — 5 Elements Max

A compact monitoring control panel showing all systems healthy. Clean, confident, calm.

**Element 1 — Control Panel Body:**
Rectangular panel. Dark Gray body with Vintage Cream edge highlights. Corner rivets (Light Gray circles, 4-6 total). Industrial but clean. Slightly vertical orientation. This is the anchor element.

**Element 2 — Pressure Gauges (3 gauges, 1 row):**
Three circular pressure gauges arranged in a single horizontal row on the panel face. Each gauge: Dark Gray rim, Vintage Cream face, color zones only (Rust Orange left/danger, ROI Green right/safe). All three needles pointing to the ROI Green safe zone. No numbers, no tick marks, no text.

**Element 3 — Indicator Lights:**
3-4 small ROI Green circles arranged below the gauges on the panel. Simple LED-style status indicators. All green — system healthy.

**Element 4 — Connected Pipe (Bottom):**
Short pipe stub extending from the bottom of the panel. Light Gray pipe with ROI Green liquid visible inside. Shows the panel is physically connected to and monitoring the infrastructure.

**Element 5 — Health Glow:**
Subtle ROI Green ambient glow around the gauge needles and indicator lights. Communicates "everything is working." Simple outer rings or slight brightness — not a gradient, just a slightly larger green fill behind the elements.
