# Background Patterns
**Asset Type:** Repeating background patterns (2 patterns)
**Usage:** Website section backgrounds at 20-30% opacity
**Priority:** LOW

---

## Style Specification

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic (simplified for background use)
- Seamless tile — repeats perfectly on all edges
- Subtle, non-distracting (designed for low opacity use)
- Line-art style — outlines and simple fills only
- No text, no labels, no numbers
- No white sticker border (these are backgrounds, not stickers)
- No bright colors (will be faded at 20-30% opacity)

**Technical Specs (Both Patterns):**
- Dimensions: 800px x 800px (square tile)
- File Format: PNG with transparent background
- Resolution: 300 DPI
- Must tile seamlessly (test before finalizing)

**Color Palette:**
- Primary outlines: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Fill shapes: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Deep accents: Very Dark Gray (#1A1A1A)
- No bright colors — designed for subtle background texture

## Pattern 1: Isometric Pipe Network

**Usage:** Primary background for most sections

Repeating isometric pipe segments in line-art style. 30° angle perspective.

**Elements Per Tile:**
- 6-8 pipe segments (varying diameters)
- Mix of horizontal and vertical runs
- 2-3 junction points with valve wheels
- Simple flange connections with bolt circles
- Moderate density — enough negative space for text readability

**Pipe Styling:**
- Light Gray (#8A8A8A) outlines (2-3px weight)
- Some pipes filled with Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Pipes on multiple depth layers (some behind others)
- Rounded corners — rubber hose flexibility maintained
- Valve wheels oversized and recognizable

**Seamless Requirements:**
- Pipes must connect at all edges
- No awkward cuts mid-element
- Pattern flows naturally when repeated

## Pattern 2: Blueprint Grid

**Usage:** Alternative background for technical sections, services page

Engineering blueprint grid with minimal mechanical detail.

**Grid Structure:**
- Primary grid: Thin lines (1-2px), 80-100px spacing, Light Gray
- Secondary grid: Slightly thicker lines (2-3px), 400px spacing
- Creates visual hierarchy

**Mechanical Details (sparse, 3-5 per tile):**
- Small simplified pipe outline
- Tiny valve symbol
- Simplified gauge outline
- Small reference markers (+ symbols at intersections)
- All very subtle, line-art only
- No text, no numbers, no labels

**Seamless Requirements:**
- Grid lines align perfectly at edges
- Pattern creates infinite blueprint feel
- No visible seam when repeated

## Testing

1. Place over Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B) background
2. Apply at 20%, 25%, 30% opacity
3. Overlay text (Vintage Cream) — must remain readable
4. Test 3x3 tile grid for seamless tiling
5. View at mobile width (375px) — should scale gracefully
