# Tier 1: Diagnostic Cutaway Pipe
**Asset Type:** Service Tier Illustration
**Usage:** Services page — Tier 1 (Deep-Scan Leak Detection)
**Priority:** MEDIUM-HIGH

---

## Style Specification

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading
- No text, no labels, no numbers, no readout screens
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Pipe body / diagnostic tool: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Blockage / problem material: Rust Orange (#D35400)
- Trapped data / scan indicator: ROI Green (#39FF14)
- Structural depth: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

## Composition — 5 Elements Max

Horizontal pipe segment with a dramatic cutaway revealing a blockage inside. A diagnostic probe examines the problem.

**Element 1 — Main Pipe with Cutaway:**
Large horizontal pipe. Light Gray exterior. Front quarter removed to reveal the interior cavity. Cut edge highlighted with Vintage Cream showing pipe wall thickness. Clean flanges with bolts on the intact sections.

**Element 2 — Interior Blockage:**
Inside the revealed pipe cavity: a lumpy Rust Orange mass filling roughly 60% of the pipe diameter. Layered texture suggesting accumulated debris. This is the focal point — the "data sludge" clogging the system.

**Element 3 — Trapped Particles:**
ROI Green droplets backed up behind the blockage. Some particles partially stuck in the clog material. Varied sizes. Shows value being blocked from flowing through.

**Element 4 — Diagnostic Probe:**
Thin flexible cable descending from the top into the pipe through an access port. Small cylindrical head with a ROI Green lens "eye." The probe points directly at the blockage. Simple — just cable, head, and lens glow.

**Element 5 — Exterior Leak Indicators:**
2-3 small Rust Orange drips on the exterior underside of the pipe. Subtle exterior staining near the blockage area. Shows the problem is leaking outward.

## Color Distribution

- Light Gray (#8A8A8A): 35% — pipe body, probe
- Rust Orange (#D35400): 30% — blockage, staining, drips
- ROI Green (#39FF14): 20% — trapped particles, probe lens
- Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC): 10% — cutaway edge, highlights
- Black (#000000): 5% — outlines

## Visual Purpose

**Paired With:** "Forensic analysis of raw CRM data to find orphaned leads, broken syncs, and silent leakage."

Communicates: We use precision tools to find hidden problems. Not guessing — analyzing.
