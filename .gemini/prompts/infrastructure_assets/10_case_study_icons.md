## Style Specification (All 4 Icons)

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic (simplified)
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of each subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading
- Very simple — optimized for display at 60-80px
- No text, no labels, no numbers
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (2-3px, slightly thinner for small size)

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Infrastructure: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Success / flow: ROI Green (#39FF14) — dominant (these are success stories)
- Structural depth: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

## Icon 1: Intelligent Routing
**Case Study:** 32% Revenue Increase

Y-shaped pipe junction. One input pipe (bottom), two output pipes (upper-left, upper-right). Light Gray pipe material. ROI Green particles flowing in from bottom, splitting intelligently between the two outputs. Small ROI Green glow at the junction point suggesting smart decision-making. Simple — just the junction and flow.

**Color:** 50% Light Gray, 40% ROI Green, 10% Dark Gray

## Icon 2: Monitoring Dashboard
**Case Study:** 40% Churn Reduction

Single large pressure gauge. Vintage Cream face. Dark Gray rim. Color zones only — Rust Orange (left/danger) and ROI Green (right/safe). Needle pointing firmly into the ROI Green safe zone. No numbers, no text. Clean and healthy.

**Color:** 50% Vintage Cream, 35% ROI Green, 15% Dark Gray

## Icon 3: Consolidation
**Case Study:** 75% Cost Reduction

Three small input pipes (left) of different shapes merging into a single large output pipe (right). Input pipes: Dark Gray with subtle Rust Orange tinting (fragmentation). Output pipe: Light Gray with ROI Green glow inside (unified, healthy). A funnel-shaped manifold at the merge point with small rivets.

**Color:** 40% Light Gray, 30% ROI Green, 30% Dark Gray/Rust Orange

## Icon 4: Scale / Growth
**Case Study:** 20-Person Team Management

Small pipe on the left gradually increasing in diameter to a large pipe on the right. Continuous transition — shows growth capacity. Light Gray pipe material. ROI Green flow visible inside, getting stronger/brighter as the pipe gets larger. Simple size progression — small to large.

**Color:** 60% Light Gray, 35% ROI Green, 5% Dark Gray

## Testing

**Small Size Test (60px x 60px):** Shape and color tell the story. Main concept identifiable. Fine details not required.

**Card Context Test:** Place in corner of case study card mockup. Should enhance, not distract. Should not compete with text.
