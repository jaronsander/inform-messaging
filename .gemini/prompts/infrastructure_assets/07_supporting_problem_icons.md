## Style Specification (All 7 Icons)

- 1930s rubber hose animation aesthetic
- Die-cut vinyl sticker — the white border (8-10px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of each subject, NOT a circle or rectangle. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around the subject.
- Flat vector illustration — no gradients, no 3D shading
- Simple, bold, instantly readable at 60px x 60px
- No text, no labels, no numbers
- No faces, expressions, or character features on objects
- Bold black outlines (3-4px) on all elements

**Background:** Solid Cyan (#00FFFF) — utility color for chroma-key removal. The sticker itself must contain zero cyan. Final composites use Carbon Gray (#2B2B2B).

**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
- Tools / infrastructure: Light Gray (#8A8A8A)
- Success / healthy: ROI Green (#39FF14)
- Problems / warnings: Rust Orange (#D35400)
- Gauge faces / highlights: Vintage Cream (#F5F5DC)
- Structural depth: Dark Gray (#3A3A3A)
- Sticker border: Pure White (#FFFFFF)
- Outlines: Pure Black (#000000)

**Technical Specs:**
- Dimensions: 600px x 600px (square) per icon
- File Format: PNG with transparent background
- Resolution: 300 DPI
- Line Weight: 3-4px black outlines
- White Border: 8-10px

## Icon 1: Broken Pressure Gauge

Single pressure gauge, center frame, large. Dark Gray housing. Vintage Cream face. Diagonal crack across the glass (bold black crack lines). Needle pinned in the Rust Orange danger zone. Color zones only — Rust Orange (left/danger), ROI Green (right/safe, unreachable). Small Rust Orange drip below gauge.

**Color:** 50% Vintage Cream, 25% Rust Orange, 15% Dark Gray, 10% ROI Green

## Icon 2: Clock + Wrench

Classic clock face (circular, center). Vintage Cream face with simple tick marks around the edge (no numbers). Black clock hands. Light Gray wrench overlaid diagonally across the clock at 45°. Small Rust Orange accent shape in the corner (warning indicator). Communicates: time wasted on manual cleanup.

**Color:** 45% Vintage Cream, 35% Light Gray, 15% Rust Orange, 5% Black

## Icon 3: Blocked Valve

Industrial wheel-handle valve (center). Light Gray valve body. Rust Orange tape/ribbon tangled around the valve wheel, physically preventing it from turning. The blockage is visible and restrictive. No text on the tape — just bold Rust Orange wrapped material.

**Color:** 40% Light Gray, 40% Rust Orange, 20% Dark Gray

---

## Icon 4: Clean Pipe Segment

Thick horizontal pipe segment. Light Gray exterior with heavy bolting on flanges (stability). Interior shows a solid glowing bar of ROI Green (healthy flow). Clean connections, tight seals. Small ROI Green glow around the flanges.

**Color:** 50% Light Gray, 50% ROI Green

---

## Icon 5: Rusty Pipe Segment

Horizontal pipe segment. Dark Gray base material. Heavy Rust Orange corrosion patches spreading across the surface. Visible kink or bend. Micro-crack with a drip forming beneath. Loose flange connection with missing bolts. Rust staining around joints.

**Color:** 60% Rust Orange, 30% Dark Gray, 10% Black

---

## Icon 6: Flowing Data

ROI Green particles flowing left to right along a smooth upward-curving path. Particles include small circles and dollar sign ($) shapes. The flow path is a Dark Gray ribbon/pathway that the particles travel along. Movement suggested by particle spacing (closer together at start, spreading out at end). Clean, energetic, directional.

**Color:** 70% ROI Green, 25% Dark Gray, 5% Black

---

## Icon 7: Stuck Data

U-shaped pipe trap (like a sink P-trap). Light Gray pipe. At the bottom of the U: heavy dollar sign ($) shapes sitting in a pool of Rust Orange stagnant liquid. Small spiderweb shapes on the trapped $ symbols (stuck for a long time). Shows value trapped and decaying in neglected infrastructure.

**Color:** 40% Rust Orange, 30% ROI Green, 30% Light Gray

## Testing

**Thumbnail Test (60px x 60px):** Main element identifiable, color coding clear, icon purpose obvious.

**Mobile Test:** Readable at mobile card size, no critical detail lost, high contrast maintained.

**Grayscale Test:** Still distinguishable by shape alone.

## Generation Order

1. Icons 4 & 5 (pipe segments — similar composition)
2. Icons 6 & 7 (data flow — similar particle concepts)
3. Icons 1 & 3 (mechanical warnings — gauges/valves)
4. Icon 2 (unique composition)
