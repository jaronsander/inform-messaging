## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the rectangular panel body itself (the panel IS the shape), with only flat cyan visible outside. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE REVOPS DASHBOARD]
The icon represents "The Observatory layer," "Telemetry," and "Ongoing monitoring." The subject is a modular industrial control panel.
1. **The Panel Housing:** A rectangular industrial control box rendered in Dark Gray (#3A3A3A). The panel should have a few "rivets" (simple black circles) at the corners to enhance the 1930s industrial feel.
2. **The Gauges:** The panel features three circular pressure gauges. Each gauge has a white/light-grey face with color zones only — Rust Orange (danger/left) and Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) (safe/right). No numbers, no tick marks, no text. Simple black needles, all positioned in the ROI Green zone.
3. **The Controls:** Below the gauges, the panel has two large, black, circular adjustment knobs and one lever switch in the up position. No labels or text on any controls.
4. **The Success State:** To signify that the system is "healthy" and "online," a small 1930s-style "energy sparkle" or "shine" (four-pointed star) in Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) can be placed near one of the gauges.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** This icon visualizes "The Dashboard" or "The Brain." It represents the observability layer that Inform Growth installs to ensure "Flow Assurance." It is the technical heart of the "Digital Plumbing" system.
- **Style Details:** The look should be clean, authoritative, and optimistic. The use of Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) on all the gauges signifies a state of "High-Flow" and success across the entire system.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Panel Housing: #3A3A3A (Dark Gray)
  - Gauge Success Zones & Sparkles: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Gauge Faces: #F5F5DC (Vintage Cream)
  - Linework/Knobs/Switch: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D. Depth is achieved through the overlap of knobs and gauges on the panel face.
- **STICKER BORDER:** The bold white border must perfectly encapsulate the rectangular panel.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "master control board from a 1930s futuristic laboratory." It is a clean, modular icon that communicates technical control, system health, and professional monitoring.
