## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the pipe and its green jet blast, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, or textures — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE HIGH-PRESSURE REVENUE ENGINE]
The icon represents "Engineering-grade infrastructure" and "99.9% Uptime." The subject is an industrial pipe functioning at maximum capacity.
1. **The Pipe:** A straight, horizontal industrial pipe segment in Light Gray (#8A8A8A). The pipe has a "vibrating" or "humming" look, indicated by 1930s-style "energy lines" (small black curved lines) around the body.
2. **The Flow (High Pressure):** From the right-hand open end of the pipe, a powerful, thick, and focused jet of Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) liquid is blasting out. This is not a drip; it is a high-velocity stream. The blast should have "speed lines" (horizontal black lines) and "impact sparks" (small four-pointed stars) in Neon Green at the point of exit.
3. **The Texture:** The pipe looks polished and brand new. There are zero leaks, zero rust spots, and zero patches. It is the perfect "Success State" of revenue plumbing.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** This is the "Refactored" state. It communicates that when the plumbing is done right, revenue flows with massive pressure and efficiency. The "High-Flow" is the primary visual anchor.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Pipe: #8A8A8A (Light Gray)
  - Revenue Flow & Sparks: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Linework/Speed Lines: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS / NO 3D:** Strictly flat 2D vector.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "technical drawing of a high-speed data turbine from a 1930s cartoon." It is the ultimate "Good State" icon.
