## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration that meticulously emulates the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The aesthetic captures the industrial, mechanical feel of a vintage boiler room with modern "Digital Plumbing" precision. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the gauge and its drip, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE BROKEN ROI GAUGE]
The icon represents "Revenue lost annually from bad data" and "Data debt compounding." The subject is a shattered industrial pressure gauge.
1. **The Gauge Housing:** A heavy-duty, circular industrial gauge case rendered in Dark Gray (#3A3A3A). The housing should have a few "rivets" (simple black circles) around the edge to enhance the industrial, 1930s feel.
2. **The Shattered Face:** The glass face of the gauge is shattered. This is represented by sharp, jagged black lines spider-webbing across the white/light-grey face of the gauge. Some "shards" (flat white triangular shapes) can be seen slightly overlapping the edge of the housing to suggest physical damage.
3. **The Needle and Scale:** The gauge needle is a simple black pointer. Critically, it is pinned all the way to the far right of the scale, in a zone highlighted in a vibrant Rust Orange (#D35400). The gauge face uses color zones only — Rust Orange (danger/right) and a small ROI Green (#39FF14) section (safe/left, unreachable). No text, no numbers, no labels on the gauge face.
4. **The "Leak":** To further emphasize the "Digital Plumbing" theme, a small, vibrant Rust Orange (#D35400) "drip" or "puddle" should be visible at the bottom of the gauge, as if it is leaking "revenue liquid."

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** The "Broken Gauge" visualizes the catastrophic failure of revenue systems when data debt is ignored. The "ROI" is no longer being measured accurately, and the system is "red-lining" in the loss zone.
- **Style Details:** The overall look should be high-contrast and bold. The contrast between the Dark Gray housing, the white face, and the vibrant Rust Orange "Loss" indicator must be stark and immediately legible even at small icon sizes.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Gauge Housing: #3A3A3A (Dark Gray)
  - Loss Zone & Drips: #D35400 (Rust Orange)
  - Gauge Face: #F5F5DC (Vintage Cream)
  - Linework/Needle: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D. Depth is achieved through the layering of flat shapes.
- **STICKER BORDER:** The white border must be a consistent thickness (approx 5-8% of the total width) and follow the circular shape of the gauge perfectly.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "danger warning from a 1930s factory reimagined as a modern SaaS metric icon." It is a powerful, high-contrast visual that immediately communicates financial risk and system failure.
