## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the gauge body and antenna, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE OBSERVABILITY GAUGE]
The icon represents "Stage 3: The Brain" and "Continuous monitoring to prevent new debt from accumulating." The subject is a healthy industrial gauge with a telemetry antenna mounted on top.
1. **The Gauge:** A heavy-duty, circular industrial gauge case rendered in Dark Gray (#3A3A3A). The face of the gauge is white or very light grey with color zones only — Rust Orange (danger/left) and Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) (safe/right). No numbers, no tick marks, no text. The needle is a simple black pointer, positioned in the ROI Green zone. The needle should point toward the top center.
2. **The Antenna:** Emerging from the absolute top center of the gauge's circular housing is a thin, black, squiggly antenna representing telemetry and signal broadcasting. It must have 2-3 gentle "S" curves.
3. **The Tip:** At the very tip of the antenna sits a glowing, neon green (#39FF14) upward-pointing equilateral triangle. This is the "Success State" indicator and represents that the system is being actively monitored and is healthy.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** This icon visualizes "Observability" and "Telemetry." By combining the "Industrial Gauge" (measurement) with the "Antenna" (signal/telemetry), it represents a system that is not only working but is "broadcasting" its health status in real-time.
- **Style Details:** The look should be clean, professional, and optimistic. The use of Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) signifies health, success, and "High-Flow" data.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Gauge Housing: #3A3A3A (Dark Gray)
  - Success Zone & Antenna Tip: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Gauge Face: #F5F5DC (Vintage Cream)
  - Linework/Needle: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D.
- **STICKER BORDER:** The bold white border must perfectly encapsulate the combined silhouette of the gauge and the antenna.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "high-tech industrial monitor from a 1930s futuristic cartoon." It is a clean, authoritative icon that communicates reliability, monitoring, and engineering success.
