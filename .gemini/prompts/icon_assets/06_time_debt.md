## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the bulging pipe and attached wrenches, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, no 3D shading — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE CLOCK CLOG]
The icon represents "20 hrs/month wasted on manual cleanup" and "Data debt compounding."
1. **The Pipe:** An industrial pipe that has a massive, unnatural "bulge" in the middle. The pipe is Light Gray (#8A8A8A).
2. **The Clog:** Lodged inside the bulge of the pipe is a large, vintage 1930s alarm clock shape. The clock is physically stretching the pipe walls. The clock face has no numbers — just simple tick marks and two black hands pointing in chaotic directions. An alarm bell shape on top. Represents the "chaos" of manual work.
3. **The Manual Labor:** Surrounding the bulge, two or three small industrial wrenches (without characters) are "taped" or "strapped" to the pipe with duct tape (flat grey shapes). This represents the "manual cleanup" patches that aren't actually fixing the internal clog.
4. **The Stagnant Flow:** On the output side of the pipe, only a few thick, slow-moving "chunky" drops of Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) are emerging, signifying that the "Time Debt" is killing the flow.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** Time is a physical obstruction. When you waste time on manual cleanup, it literally "clogs" the revenue funnel, preventing efficiency.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Pipe: #8A8A8A (Light Gray)
  - Revenue/Flow: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Manual Patches: #D35400 (Rust Orange)
  - Linework/Clock: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS / NO 3D:** Strictly flat 2D vector.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like an "X-ray of a pipe that has swallowed a clock." It is a clear visual of a "bottleneck" caused by time waste.
