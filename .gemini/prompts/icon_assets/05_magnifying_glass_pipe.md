## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the magnifying glass and pipe, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects (no eyes, mouths, smiles on tools, pipes, or lenses). No gradients, no 3D shading, no textures — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE LEAK DETECTION]
The icon represents "Find hidden revenue buried under data debt." The subject is a magnifying glass revealing a major leak in a broken pipe.
1. **The Pipe:** A horizontal pipe segment in Light Gray (#8A8A8A). 
2. **The Leak (The Signal):** Positioned centrally, a large cartoon magnifying glass is "looking" at a jagged crack in the pipe. Under the glass, we see a heavy "spray" of Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) liquid escaping the system. This is the "lost revenue."
3. **The Pitiful Flow:** To show the impact of the leak, the exit end (the right side) of the pipe shows a weak, sad, and pitiful "trickle" of only a few small Green drops. The contrast between the high-pressure leak at the crack and the weak flow at the end must be obvious.
4. **The Magnifying Glass:** Bold black frame and handle. The lens area highlights the leak with high contrast.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** The "Deep-Scan" finds where your money is actually going. It visualizes "Orphaned Pipeline" as liquid that is literally spraying out of the pipes before it reaches the destination.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Pipe: #8A8A8A (Light Gray)
  - Revenue/Leak: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Magnifying glass frame/Linework: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)
  - Highlights: #F5F5DC (Vintage Cream)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO FACES OR CHARACTERS** on the magnifying glass or any object.
- **NO GRADIENTS / NO 3D:** Strictly flat 2D vector.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "detective finding a crime scene in a plumbing factory." It makes the problem (the leak) and the consequence (the pitiful flow) immediately clear.
