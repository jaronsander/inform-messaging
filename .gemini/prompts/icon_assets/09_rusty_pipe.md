## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the corroded pipe and its drips, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE CORRODED DATA DEBT PIPE]
The icon represents "Corroding infrastructure," "Data debt," and the "Problem state." The subject is a single, decaying industrial pipe segment.
1. **The Pipe:** A single, straight, horizontal industrial pipe segment. It is colored in a dull Dark Gray (#3A3A3A). The pipe features two bold black circular "flanges" at either end, but one flange should look slightly "bent" or "warped."
2. **The Corrosion:** The surface of the pipe is covered in "rust spots" and "pitting," represented by irregular flat shapes in a vibrant Rust Orange (#D35400). A large "crack" or "fissure" runs along the side of the pipe, outlined in bold black.
3. **The Leak:** From the crack in the pipe, thick, viscous liquid is leaking. This liquid is a vibrant Rust Orange (#D35400). The leak should be rendered as a heavy "ink blot" drip, following the 1930s cartoon style. One or two small "drips" should be in mid-air below the pipe.
4. **The Geometry:** The pipe should look "tired" and "stressed," with a slightly uneven silhouette, following the 1930s cartoon aesthetic where objects reflect their condition.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** This icon visualizes "The Problem." It is the physical manifestation of "Data Debt"—infrastructure that has been neglected and is now "leaking" revenue. It is the antithesis of the "Clean Pipe."
- **Style Details:** The overall look should be one of "industrial decay." The contrast between the dark grey pipe and the bright, sickly orange of the rust and leaks is the core visual message.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Pipe Segment: #3A3A3A (Dark Gray)
  - Rust & Leaks: #D35400 (Rust Orange)
  - Linework/Cracks: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D.
- **STICKER BORDER:** The bold white border must perfectly encapsulate the corroded pipe segment.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "danger warning from an old, neglected boiler room in a 1930s cartoon." It is a visceral, high-contrast icon that makes the concept of "infrastructure decay" feel physical, urgent, and problematic.
