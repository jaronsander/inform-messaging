## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the crossed wrench and pipe, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE PLUMBING / IMPLEMENTATION]
The icon represents "Stage 2: The Plumbing" and "Refactor broken infrastructure with durable engineering." The subject is a large industrial pipe wrench crossing a section of clean pipe.
1. **The Pipe Segment:** A single, straight, horizontal industrial pipe segment rendered in Light Gray (#8A8A8A). The pipe is "Clean," meaning it has no leaks or rust. It represents the "Refactored" state of the revenue funnel.
2. **The Wrench:** A massive, oversized industrial pipe wrench with a vibrant Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) handle is crossing the pipe at an angle. The wrench represents the "Engineering" and "Implementation" work being done. 
3. **The Connection:** The wrench should be positioned as if it is actively tightening a joint or flange on the pipe. A few small 1930s-style "sparks" or "energy lines" in Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) can be placed near the point of contact to suggest active work and "Success."

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** This icon visualizes "Implementation" and "The Fix." It represents the heavy lifting required to move from a "leaky" system to a "refactored" one. The use of Green on the wrench handle signifies that this work is high-value and results in ROI.
- **Style Details:** The overall look should be powerful and capable. The contrast between the light gray pipe and the bright green wrench handle communicates the positive impact of the plumbing work.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Pipe Segment: #8A8A8A (Light Gray)
  - Wrench Handle & Sparks: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Wrench Head/Linework: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D. Depth is achieved through the overlap of the wrench and the pipe.
- **STICKER BORDER:** The bold white border must perfectly encapsulate the combined silhouette.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "technical logo for a master craftsman from a 1930s industrial cartoon." It is a clean, authoritative icon that communicates capability, engineering rigor, and the physical act of "fixing" the pipeline.
