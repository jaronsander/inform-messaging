## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration in the classic 1930s "rubber hose" animation style. The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the complex contour of the tangled pipes, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No faces, expressions, or character features on objects. No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE TANGLED DATA DEBT PIPES]
The icon represents "Data debt accumulating," "broken syncs," and "corroding revenue infrastructure." The subject is a complex, tangled mess of industrial plumbing.
1. **The Pipes and Hoses:** The composition consists of several overlapping industrial pipes and flexible hoses. Some pipes should be straight and rigid, while others should be "rubber hose" style—thin, flexible, and knotted. These should be colored in Light Gray (#8A8A8A).
2. **The "Patches":** To represent "workarounds" and "duct tape" fixes, several sections of the pipes should have visible "patches." These are rendered as simple flat shapes (rectangles) wrapped around the pipes, colored in a slightly lighter grey or black to suggest duct tape or metal bands.
3. **The Leaks:** From several "cracks" and "joints" in the pipes, thick, viscous liquid is leaking. This liquid is a vibrant Rust Orange (#D35400). The leaks should be rendered as heavy "ink blot" drips and splashes, following the 1930s cartoon style.
4. **The Corrosion:** Some sections of the pipes should have small "rust spots" or "pitting" effects, represented by simple black or Rust Orange (#D35400) circular dots and shapes, suggesting the infrastructure is "corroding from the inside."

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** This icon visualizes the "Data Debt" itself. It is a physical representation of a messy, poorly architected, and "leaking" revenue system. The tangle of pipes represents the complexity that grows exponentially as debt compounds.
- **Style Details:** The overall look should be "Industrial Cyberpunk." It is a mechanical nightmare rendered with the charm and simplicity of a 1930s cartoon. The contrast between the Light Gray pipes and the vibrant Rust Orange leaks must be stark.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Pipes & Hoses: #8A8A8A (Light Gray)
  - Leaks & Rust: #D35400 (Rust Orange)
  - Patches/Linework: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D. Depth is created through the layered overlap of the pipes and hoses.
- **STICKER BORDER:** The white border must perfectly encapsulate the entire tangled mess, maintaining a consistent thickness throughout the silhouette.

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "technical drawing of a plumbing disaster from a 1930s cartoon." It is a visceral, high-contrast icon that makes the abstract concept of "data debt" feel tangible, physical, and urgent.
