## The Master Prompt (Exhaustive Technical Specification)

[ASSET ARCHITECTURE: STYLE, FORMAT, AND DELIVERY]
This image must be generated as a primary-source, ultra-clean flat vector illustration that meticulously emulates the 1930s "rubber hose" animation style (Fleischer Studios, Ub Iwerks). The final asset is a die-cut vinyl sticker. "Die-cut" means the white (#FFFFFF) border (6-8px) follows the IRREGULAR SILHOUETTE of the subject — NOT a circle, NOT a rectangle, NOT a badge or medallion shape. The border traces the contour of the funnel and robot, with only flat cyan visible in the gaps. No additional frames, outlines, or geometric shapes around or behind the subject. The entire image background — the area OUTSIDE the white sticker border — must be a perfectly flat, solid field of Cyan (#00FFFF). This cyan is a chroma-key utility color for post-production removal only. **The sticker itself must contain ZERO cyan (#00FFFF).** No gradients, shadows, textures, or 3D effects — strictly flat 2D vector.

[ICON SUBJECT: THE AI CLOG]
The icon represents "AI deployments blocked by corrupted foundations." The subject is a small, 1930s-style robot character stuck inside a large industrial funnel.
1. **The Robot:** The robot should be a simple, charming character with a perfectly round or boxy head, classic "pie-cut" eyes (black ovals with a triangular wedge highlight), and thin, light-grey "noodle" limbs (no joints). The robot is stuck upside down in the funnel, with its noodle-legs kicking in the air in a comical "rubber hose" panic. The robot should be colored in Light Gray (#8A8A8A) with Neon ROI Green (#39FF14) accents (e.g., a glowing power light or eye highlight).
2. **The Funnel:** A large, heavy-duty industrial funnel made of light gray metal. The funnel is positioned vertically. The robot is lodged firmly in the top, wider opening.
3. **The Clog/Leak:** From the narrow bottom tip of the funnel, thick, viscous, black "data oil" or "data gunk" is slowly dripping. These drips should be rendered as bold, heavy flat shapes in the 1930s "ink blot" style. One or two drips should be in mid-air to suggest a slow, problematic flow.

[VISUAL LANGUAGE AND METAPHORS]
- **Metaphor:** The "AI Clog" visualizes the friction caused by bad data infrastructure. The robot (AI) is ready to work but is physically prevented from flowing through the funnel (the revenue pipeline) because of a "clog" (data debt).
- **Style Details:** Use clean, bold black linework to define the shapes. The overall look should be "Digital Plumbing"—mechanical, slightly rusted, but charming and high-contrast.

[COLOR PALETTE AND TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS]
**Sticker Color Palette (no cyan inside the sticker):**
  - Funnel & Robot Body: #8A8A8A (Light Gray)
  - Robot Highlights: #39FF14 (Neon ROI Green)
  - Gunk/Linework: #000000 (Pure Black)
  - Sticker border: #FFFFFF (Pure White)

**Chroma-key background (NOT a sticker color):**
  - #00FFFF (Solid Cyan) — fills ONLY the area outside the white sticker border

- **ZERO CYAN (#00FFFF) INSIDE THE STICKER.** If the model generates cyan anywhere within the white border, the asset fails QA.
- **NO JOINTS:** The robot's limbs must be smooth curves.
- **NO GRADIENTS:** Every color field must be a flat, solid fill.
- **NO 3D SHADING:** The image must be strictly 2D. Depth is achieved through the overlap of flat shapes (e.g., the robot overlapping the funnel).
- **STICKER BORDER:** The white border must be thick enough to be visible at small scales (approx 5-8% of the total width).

[FINAL VISION]
The image should feel like a "vintage mechanical diagram reimagined as a cyberpunk sticker." It is a high-contrast, professional icon that communicates a complex technical problem (AI data debt) through a simple, memorable animation metaphor.
