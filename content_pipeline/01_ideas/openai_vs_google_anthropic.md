# Idea: OpenAI Cancelled -> All in on Google/Anthropic

**Source:** User Conversation (2026-01-07)
**Status:** Raw Idea

## Core Concept
I cancelled my OpenAI subscription. It feels too much like a consumer product now, less like a serious business tool. I've pivoted to a Google (Gemini) and Anthropic (Claude) stack and am much happier.

## Key Points
*   **The Shift:** Cancelled OpenAI.
*   **The Reason:** OpenAI feels "consumer-grade" now.
*   **The New Stack:**
    *   **Coding/Agent:** Claude Code + Gemini CLI.
    *   **Models:** Gemini 3 (Pro/Ultra?), Claude 3.5 Sonnet / Opus.
    *   **Legacy:** Kept Cursor for occasional OpenAI access, but rarely used.
*   **The Insight:** Google is productizing AI incredibly well. The ecosystem they are building is robust and enterprise-ready. Bullish on Google's approach.
*   **Alignment:** Fits the "System/Engineer" brand—choosing the robust tool over the hype tool.

## Potential Angles
1.  **The Engineer's Choice:** Why "Consumer AI" (OpenAI) fails for real dev work vs "Infrastructure AI" (Google/Anthropic).
2.  **Tool Fatigue:** Why I stopped chasing the shiny object and settled on the ecosystem that works.
3.  **The "Business" Pivot:** Google is building for business; OpenAI is building for virality.
