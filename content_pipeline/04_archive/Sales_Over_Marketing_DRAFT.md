# Content Drafts: Sales Over Marketing

**Idea:** People don't really care about marketing, they care about sales and are more willing to spend money on sales than marketing because of the direct tie to revenue.

## VARIATION A: Personal Story (War Story)

**Note:** This variation requires a specific personal experience. If you have a real example of a client who cut marketing spend but increased sales investment, replace the placeholder below. Otherwise, skip this variation per our "No Fabricated Stories" constraint.

[PLACEHOLDER - Needs real story from Jaron's experience]

## VARIATION B: Thought Leadership (The Expert Opinion) - REFINED

**Hook:** Challenge conventional "balanced" marketing/sales budgets

**Structure:** PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution)

Your CFO will approve a $200K sales hire before a $50K marketing campaign.

Why?

Because sales has a number attached to a name. Marketing has "brand awareness."

(This is not a hot take. This is budget reality.)

Nobody cares about your email open rates when the CRM shows 11,000 leads that were never touched.

Nobody cares about ad spend ROI when the middle of the funnel is leaking $300K/year in ghost leads.

Marketing gets judged on vanity metrics. Sales gets judged on closed deals.

So executives fund what they can measure.

The fix isn't "better marketing." It's infrastructure.

When your attribution model isn't broken, marketing spend stops being a "bet" and starts being a calculation.

But you can't build attribution on top of corrupted data.

Fix the schema. Fix the API syncs. Then measure marketing like you measure sales.

Because right now? Your CFO is right to fund sales over marketing.

Your marketing data is garbage.

## VARIATION C: Sales Post (The Direct Offer)

**Hook:** Direct sales angle targeting budget allocation pain

**Structure:** Problem → Proof → CTA

---

I'm looking for 3 VPs who are tired of defending their marketing budget.

Here's the pattern I see:

Your executive team approves sales hires instantly. (Clear ROI.)

Your marketing requests get stuck in "let's revisit next quarter." (Unclear ROI.)

The problem isn't your strategy. It's your infrastructure.

When I audit marketing stacks, here's what I find:

→ 30-40% of leads never get touched (routing failures, API timeouts)
→ Attribution models pointing at the wrong campaigns (schema mismatches)
→ "Marketing Qualified Leads" sitting in a queue for 14 days (workflow latency)

Sales gets funded because you can trace a dollar to a name.

Marketing can't get funded because your telemetry is broken.

I specialize in building observability into marketing systems so you can defend your budget with the same precision as sales.

If your marketing team is fighting for budget while sales gets a blank check, DM me "TELEMETRY."

I'll show you the 3 infrastructure leaks killing your marketing ROI.

(Free audit. 3 spots this week.)
