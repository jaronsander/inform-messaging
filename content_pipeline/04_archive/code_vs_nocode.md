# Idea: No-Code vs. Code Convergence & AI

**Core Premise:**
No-code and code are converging because of AI. 
*   AI abstracts code via natural language.
*   No-code abstracts code via visualization.

**The Problem:**
They serve different purposes but have fatal flaws.
*   **No-Code (Bubble, Make, Zapier):** Good for building blocks, but "death by a thousand clicks" for complexity. Fragile at scale. Horrible for debugging.
*   **AI Code (Replit, Lovable, Claude Code):** Allows nuance, but you lose visibility at scale. Requires strict systems/process to build big backends successfully.

**The RevOps/GTM Angle:**
RevOps sits at the intersection.
The metric that matters: **Time to Fix (Debug).** 
*   When something breaks, what allows you to find and fix it quickest?

**The Solution:**
*   **System First:** The system and process must take priority over the tool.
*   Choose the build method based on the system design, not the other way around.
