I finally cancelled my OpenAI subscription going into the new year.

For two years, it was the default. The "Google" of AI. But lately, it just hasn't been doing it for me. I feel like they are turning into too much of a consumer product and less of a business tool.

So I made the switch.

Now, my daily drivers are Claude Code and the Gemini CLI (specifically Gemini 3). Honestly? So happy with the decision.

(Gemini CLI is actually included with Google Workspace Business plans. Most people miss that.)

I am making heavy use of both Claude Skills and Gemini Skills. (Yes, Gemini cli also has skills)

The difference isn't subtle. It’s the difference between a toy and a tool.

I still have Cursor installed for the rare edge case, but I really rarely use it. 
Between Gemini 3 for speed and Claude for reasoning, my bases are covered.

It's not that I don't care about the hype cycle. It's just exhausting to keep on top of. (Decision fatigue is real.)

Eventually, you just need to choose your toolbox and decide where you are going to spend your time building, rather than just testing.

I have been increasingly impressed with how Google is productizing AI. I am very bullish on the ecosystem they are building out. It feels like they are building for builders, not just for the app store.

Anyone else feeling the shift?
