Your CFO will approve a $200K sales hire before a $50K marketing campaign.

Why?

Because sales has a number attached to a name. Marketing has "brand awareness."

(This is not a hot take. This is budget reality.)

Nobody cares about your email open rates when the CRM shows 11,000 leads that were never touched.

Nobody cares about ad spend ROI when the middle of the funnel is leaking $300K/year in ghost leads.

Marketing gets judged on vanity metrics. Sales gets judged on closed deals.

So executives fund what they can measure.

The fix isn't "better marketing." It's infrastructure.

When your attribution model isn't broken, marketing spend stops being a "bet" and starts being a calculation.

But you can't build attribution on top of corrupted data.

Fix the schema. Fix the API syncs. Then measure marketing like you measure sales.

Because right now? Your CFO is right to fund sales over marketing.

Your marketing data is garbage.
