# FINAL: The "Time-to-Fix" Metric

**Platform:** LinkedIn / Reddit
**Strategy:** Type B (Thought Leadership)

**Headline:** The most important metric in RevOps isn't "Speed to Build." It's "Time to Fix."

We are seeing a convergence.
*   **No-Code (Make, Zapier):** Abstracts code via Visualization.
*   **AI Code (Replit, Lovable):** Abstracts code via Natural Language.

Founders love them because they build fast.
Engineers hate them because they break silently.

I see RevOps teams straddling this divide every day. They build a fragile spiderweb of Zaps, then wonder why their attribution data is trash.

**The Truth:**
Visual tools are great for building blocks, but they are "death by a thousand clicks" when you hit real complexity. They are notoriously horrible for debugging.

AI-driven code tools allow for nuance, but you lose visibility at scale. Without strict systems and process-driven architecture, you can't build successful backends.

**The Metric that Matters:**
When your GTM infrastructure is scaling, stop obsessing over which tool is "faster" to deploy.
Obsess over the **Debugging Protocol**.

When a lead fails to sync on a Friday at 5 PM:
1.  Can you find the error in <5 minutes?
2.  Can you replay the data without manual entry?

If the answer is no, you haven't built a scalable stack. You've built a liability.

**System First:**
The process must take priority over the tool. Choose how you build based on the system design, not the other way around.
