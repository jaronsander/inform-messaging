## Caption

I made a cartoon character for RevOps, and the Inform Growth brand.

His name is Roy. Short for ROI. (Yeah. That's intentional.)

He's a funnel plumber. A specialist. His antenna sparks green the second it locks onto a revenue leak your CRM is hiding.

He lives in the Revenue Trenches. Trust me — it's ugly down there.

I came up with him because RevOps is brutally dry. The problems are real and expensive. But nobody looks twice until something's already broken. Roy is my shot at changing that.

Stupid? Maybe.
Fun? I think so.

You tell me. Any traits you think he should have?
