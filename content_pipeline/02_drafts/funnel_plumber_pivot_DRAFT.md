# Post: The Funnel Plumber Pivot
# Date: 2026-02-02
# Goal: Make a hypothesis about RevOps infrastructure > marketing, ask for validation, introduce the pivot.

I spent the last year building marketing tracking infrastructures.

Better attribution. Cleaner customer journey maps. Shiny dashboards.

But every conversation with clients kept circling back to the same pain point:

"Our sales process is broken. Leads are falling through the cracks. Our CRM is a mess."

That's when I had this realization:

**Revenue Operations infrastructure is more valuable to companies at any stage than marketing.**

[Marketing can't save a leaky funnel. You're just pouring more water into a broken pipe.]

If your RevOps infrastructure is broken—orphaned leads, broken syncs, manual data entry, bad routing—then better marketing is just a more expensive way to watch money disappear.

Sales is the biggest part of RevOps. But it's broader than that: it's your entire revenue engine.

So I'm pivoting Inform Growth to focus on **Funnel Plumbing:** fixing RevOps infrastructure and preventing Data Debt.

But here's my question:

**Am I in my own bubble, or do you agree with this?**

The hypothesis and the new offer are in the slides.

## Carousel Slides: The Hypothesis + The New Offer

### Slide 1: The Hypothesis
**Headline:** RevOps infrastructure > Marketing spend.

At any stage, fixing your revenue operations infrastructure delivers more value than better marketing attribution.

[Marketing can't save a leaky funnel.]

**Visual Suggestion:** `bg_black_pipes_on_grey.png` with **ROI Green** headline, **Rust Orange** bracket.

### Slide 2: Stage 1 — The Deep-Scan
**Headline:** Find your Data Debt. Or your money back.

Forensic scan of your CRM and CS platforms to find "Ghost Leads"—high-value accounts that fell through the cracks.

**Guarantee:** 50 reactivation-ready leads or $50k in orphaned pipeline. Or you don't pay.

**Visual Suggestion:** `element_gauge_success.png` overlaid on pipes background.

### Slide 3: Stage 2 — Pipeline Re-Architecture
**Headline:** Build the infrastructure you need to scale.

Map what you have today vs. what you need to hit tomorrow's revenue goals. Then I build the plumbing to bridge that gap.

[Your team focuses on clients, not admin.]

**Investment:** $12k–$30k | 4–8 weeks

**Visual Suggestion:** `element_wrench_industrial.png` angled on pipes background.

### Slide 4: Stage 3 — Flow Assurance (Observability)
**Headline:** Prevent leaks before they cost you deals.

Install telemetry that catches data corruption within 24 hours.

[99.9% uptime for your revenue engine.]
For the @funnel_plumber_pivot_DRAFT.md  , can you give me some hashtags?
**Investment:** $3k–$5k/mo ongoing

**Visual Suggestion:** `element_toolbox_sheet.png` (closed) on pipes background.

### Slide 5: What is RevOps Infrastructure?
**Headline:** The entire revenue engine.

Marketing → Sales → CS → Finance

RevOps infrastructure is the data, automation, and workflows connecting every revenue-generating function.

[This is what I'm fixing. Not just marketing.]

**Am I in my own bubble, or do you agree?**

**Visual Suggestion:** Flow diagram with pipes connecting four boxes (Marketing, Sales, CS, Finance) with `element_wrench_industrial.png` or `element_plunger_industrial.png` in the center. Use **ROI Green** for clean pipes, **Rust Orange** for leak points.

1. **Reciprocal Engagement:** Engage with 5-10 other posts (like, comment 15+ words)
2. **DM Alert:** Send DM to 3-5 highly engaged connections ("Just posted about my pivot—curious what you think")

### First 30 Minutes
3. **Respond to Every Comment:** Reply within 30 min (increases comments by 64%)
4. **Quality Responses:** Make responses 15+ words to signal deeper engagement
5. **Ask Follow-Up Questions:** Keep comment threads going (algorithmic boost)

### Monitor Metrics
