# Style Guide & Content Constraints

This file tracks negative constraints and style corrections learned from the Feedback Loop.

## 🚫 Negative Constraints (The "Don't" List)

### 1. Accuracy & Integrity
*   **No Fabricated Stories:** Never make up "War Stories" or past experiences. Only use specific examples provided in the idea file or `knowledge/proof_points/`. If no story is provided, do not use Type A (Story) templates.
*   **No "Pipeline Infrastructure Audit":** This is not a service offering. Do not use this as a Call to Action (CTA).

### 2. Tone & Voice
*   **No "Cheerleading":** Maintain the clinical, engineering-focused tone. 
*   **No Marketing Fluff:** Avoid words like "synergy," "holistic," or "unlocking potential."

### 3. Visual Constraints (Infrastructure Assets)
*   **No mascot or recurring character.** All visuals are infrastructure-focused.
*   **Cyan (#00FFFF):** Background only for chroma-key removal. Zero cyan inside any sticker.
*   **No text on images:** No labels, numbers, tick marks, or brand names. Dollar signs ($) OK.
*   **Gauges:** Color zones only (Rust Orange danger / ROI Green safe). No numbers.
*   **Element limits:** 6-8 max for illustrations, 3-4 for icons.

## ✅ Positive Constraints (The "Do" List)
*   **Prioritize "Time to Fix":** Focus on debugging, observability, and system reliability.
*   **Systems Over Tools:** Always emphasize that the process/system design dictates the tool choice.
*   **Bracketed Quips:** Use short, punchy side commentary in brackets. (Like this.) Avoid full sentences in brackets.
*   **Plain Text Formatting:** For LinkedIn drafts, do NOT use Markdown headers (# Headline). Use spacing and capitalization for structure instead.
