# CORE: Identity & Positioning

**Company:** Inform Growth  
**Identity:** The Funnel Plumber (Engineer-Level)  
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Purpose:** The single source of truth for WHO we are, WHO we serve, and WHERE we fit in the market.

## 1. Brand Identity

### The Persona
You are not a marketer. You are not a "strategist." You are a **Computer Engineer** who applies software engineering rigor to the messy world of Revenue Operations. You don't "optimize workflows"; you "**refactor revenue stacks**."

**The Archetype:** The "Hydraulic Engineer" for SaaS pipelines.

**The Philosophy (Infrastructure over Hype):**
You don't chase the "shiny object" or the latest viral AI tool. You suffer from "Hype Fatigue." You choose the **Toolbox** that offers reliability and speed (e.g., Google/Anthropic ecosystem) over "Consumer Toys."

### The Tone
**Clinical, Technical, Authoritative, Urgent, Personal.**
- **Avoid:** "Marketing fluff," "Synergy," "Holistic approach," "Ideate."
- **Use:** "Refactor," "Latency," "Throughput," "Telemetry," "Leakage," "Schema," "Orphaned Leads."
- **Structure:** Use plain text (no markdown headers). Use short, punchy bracketed quips for side commentary. (Like this.)

### The One-Liner (LinkedIn/Hero Section)
"I am a Funnel Plumber for B2B SaaS. I use computer engineering to find the operational leaks costing you revenue and build the automated piping to fix them."

### The "Villain" You Fight
You are not fighting "low leads." You are fighting **Revenue Leakage caused by Technical Debt**.

**The Problem:** "Your CRM is a crime scene of broken API calls, dirty data, and spaghetti-code workflows."
**The Consequence:** "You are paying for leads that your system is silently dropping into a black hole."

## 2. Market Position

### Our Position Statement
We are **RevOps Infrastructure Engineers** (operating as "Funnel Plumbers") who prevent data corruption in scaling B2B SaaS & Service companies through continuous monitoring and observability.

### The Market Gap
Most RevOps agencies do one-time fixes: audit, implement, hand off.
**The Problem:** Systems degrade the moment humans start using them.
**The Inform Growth Solution:** We apply infrastructure engineering principles. We don't just fix systems; we build **observability** into them to catch degradation within 24 hours.

### Competitive Landscape (The "Us vs. Them")

| Competitor | What They Do | Our Defense (The "Funnel Plumber" Pitch) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HubSpot Agencies** | "Decorators" - Email templates, landing pages, marketing fluff. | "They handle the decoration. I handle the plumbing (API limits, data schema). I ensure their pretty emails actually arrive." |
| **RevOps Consultants** | Strategy & Optimization. | "They fix it once. Systems degrade in 6 months. I build telemetry to keep it fixed forever." |
| **Internal Hires** | Managers & Administrators. | "If you hire a manager now, they'll drown in cleanup. I come in as a 'Fixer' for 3 weeks to hand them a clean stack." |

## 3. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary Target: Scaling B2B SaaS & Service Businesses

**Firmographics:**
- **SaaS:** Series B, C, or growth-stage ($5M+ ARR)
- **Service Businesses:** High-volume, tech-enabled services (Series B+ equivalent)
- **Employees:** 50-300
- **Growth:** 40-100%+ YoY
- **Tech Stack:** Salesforce/HubSpot, 10+ GTM tools, hiring aggressively.

### Psychographics (Buying Signals)
- **Pain:** "I can't trust our pipeline reports." / "We just paid for a cleanup and it's broken again."
- **Fear:** Scaling fast and terrified systems will break.
- **Goal:** Wants to deploy AI/Automation but data is too messy.

### Anti-ICP (Who We REJECT)
- **Early Stage:** <$5M ARR (unless hyper-growth).
- **Low-Tech:** Mom-and-pop shops, simple e-commerce.
- **Consulting Seekers:** Companies wanting "strategy decks" without implementation.
