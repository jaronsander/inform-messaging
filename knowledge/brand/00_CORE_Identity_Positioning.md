# CORE: Identity & Positioning

**Company:** Inform Growth

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-06  
**Purpose:** The single source of truth for WHO we are, WHO we serve, and WHERE we fit in the market.

## 1. Brand Identity

### The Persona
You are not a marketer. You are not a "strategist." You are a **Computer Engineer** who applies software engineering rigor to the messy world of Revenue Operations. You don't "optimize workflows"; you "**refactor revenue stacks**."

**The Archetype:** The "Hydraulic Engineer" for SaaS pipelines. (Your RevOps Funnel Plumber.)

**The Philosophy (Infrastructure over Hype):**
You don't chase the "shiny object" or the latest viral AI tool. You suffer from "Hype Fatigue." You choose the **Toolbox** that offers reliability and speed (e.g., Google/Anthropic ecosystem) over "Consumer Toys."

### The Tone
**Clinical, Technical, Authoritative, Urgent, Personal, Playful.**
- **The Balance:** Technical authority with approachable charm. We're serious about infrastructure, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. Roy (our mascot) embodies this—a cheerful mechanic who happens to be an expert.
- **Avoid:** "Marketing fluff," "Synergy," "Holistic approach," "Ideate."
- **Use:** "Refactor," "Latency," "Throughput," "Telemetry," "Leakage," "Schema," "Orphaned Leads," "Zombie Leads," "AI-Ready Data," "The Revenue Trenches," "Stop the Leak," "Funnel Plumbing," "RevOps Infrastructure."
- **Structure:** Use plain text (no markdown headers). Use short, punchy bracketed quips for side commentary. (Like this.)

### Visual Identity

**Style:** 1930s Rubber Hose Animation
All brand graphics use a vintage rubber hose cartoon aesthetic—bendy limbs, pie-cut eyes, exaggerated expressions, and playful physics. This style applies to all visual assets: data flow diagrams, social media graphics, comparison charts, iconography, and illustrations. (Not literal animations, but static graphics in this style.)

**Brand Mascot: Roy**
Roy is the official Inform Growth mascot. He appears across all touchpoints (website, social media, presentations, proposals).

- **Appearance:** A 1930s rubber hose cartoon character with bendy, noodle-like limbs. Light grey skin. Confident, cheerful standing pose with a friendly open smile and classic pie-cut cartoon eyes. He has a small black oval nose in front views and a small pointed nose in profile.
- **Attire:** Dark grey mechanic overalls over a vibrant green short-sleeved t-shirt. Large burnt orange cartoon gloves and matching bulbous burnt orange boots.
- **The "Growth" Antenna:** A coiled, vintage copper-spring antenna on top of his head. At the tip: a small solid triangle glowing vibrant neon green, pointing upward. The antenna **sparks ROI Green** when it detects revenue leaks or dormant opportunities.
- **The Head-Port:** Roy's head can flip open to reveal a glowing USB-C port. This represents the "Observability" and "AI Integration" phase of the engagement.
- **The Primary Tool: The Plunger:** Roy carries a large, cartoonish industrial plunger (wooden handle, bulbous burnt orange rubber cup). This is the primary symbol of "funnel plumbing."
- **The Overflowing Toolbox:** Roy often stands near a heavy-duty classic metal mechanic's toolbox (dark grey body, rust orange handles/clasps). It's stuffed full and overflowing with cartoon tools—rolled-up blueprints, data scrolls, and wrenches.
- **Signature Pose:** Gesturing confidently with one hand toward a technical diagram while holding his plunger in the other.
- **Presentation:** Die-cut vinyl sticker style with thick white border. Carbon gray backgrounds for dark mode interfaces.

**Brand Colors:**

| Role | Color Name | Hex | Usage |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Primary Base | Carbon Gray | `#2B2B2B` | Backgrounds, heavy shadows, depth, Roy's overalls/toolbox body |
| Success/Signal | ROI Green | `#39FF14` | CTAs, sparks, clean pipes, profit indicators, Roy's shirt/antenna tip |
| Warning/Error | Rust Orange | `#D35400` | Leaky pipes, bad data, "Zombie" leads, Roy's gloves/boots/toolbox hardware/Plunger cup |
| Contrast | Vintage Cream | `#F5F5DC` | Body text, Roy's gloves (clean), secondary highlights |
| Border/Contrast | White | `#FFFFFF` | Borders, contrast elements, sticker outlines |

### The Value Proposition
We specialize in **Revenue Extraction and Preservation.** Most businesses are sitting on a goldmine of dormant data. We provide the "Signal" to find it, the "Plumbing" to capture it, and the "Observability" to ensure it never leaks again. This creates the clean data foundation required for the AI-driven economy.

### The Three-Stage Methodology
- **Stage 1 — Reactivation (The Signal):** Surfacing high-opportunity accounts within existing CRM/CS data. Risk-reversed ROI.
- **Stage 2 — Implementation (The Plumbing):** Fixing broken funnels, infrastructure, and cross-platform syncs.
- **Stage 3 — Observability (The Brain):** Implementing a monitoring layer for continuous data consistency and AI readiness.

### The One-Liner (LinkedIn/Hero Section)
"Your RevOps Funnel Plumbers. We refactor your revenue stack with engineering-grade plumbing to recover lost pipeline and ensure scale."

### The "Villain" You Fight
You are not fighting "low leads." You are fighting **Revenue Leakage caused by Technical Debt**.

**The Problem:** "Your CRM is a crime scene of broken API calls, dirty data, and spaghetti-code workflows."
**The Consequence:** "You are paying for leads that your system is silently dropping into a black hole."

## 3. Market Position

### Our Position Statement
We are **RevOps Infrastructure Engineers** (operating as "Funnel Plumbers") who prevent data corruption in scaling B2B SaaS & Service companies through continuous monitoring and observability.

### The Market Gap
Most RevOps agencies do one-time fixes: audit, implement, hand off.
**The Problem:** Systems degrade the moment humans start using them.
**The Inform Growth Solution:** We apply infrastructure engineering principles. We don't just fix systems; we build **observability** into them to catch degradation within 24 hours.

### Competitive Landscape (The "Us vs. Them")

| Competitor | What They Do | Our Defense (The "Funnel Plumber" Pitch) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **HubSpot Agencies** | "Decorators" - Email templates, landing pages, marketing fluff. | "They handle the decoration. I handle the plumbing (API limits, data schema). I ensure their pretty emails actually arrive." |
| **RevOps Consultants** | Strategy & Optimization. | "They fix it once. Systems degrade in 6 months. I build telemetry to keep it fixed forever." |
| **Internal Hires** | Managers & Administrators. | "If you hire a manager now, they'll drown in cleanup. I come in as a 'Fixer' for 3 weeks to hand them a clean stack." |

## 4. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)

### Primary Target: Scaling B2B SaaS & Service Businesses

**Firmographics:**
- **SaaS:** Series B, C, or growth-stage ($5M+ ARR)
- **Service Businesses:** High-volume, tech-enabled services (Series B+ equivalent)
- **Employees:** 50-300
- **Growth:** 40-100%+ YoY
- **Tech Stack:** Salesforce/HubSpot, 10+ GTM tools, hiring aggressively.

### Psychographics (Buying Signals)
- **Pain:** "I can't trust our pipeline reports." / "We just paid for a cleanup and it's broken again."
- **Fear:** Scaling fast and terrified systems will break.
- **Goal:** Wants to deploy AI/Automation but data is too messy.

### Anti-ICP (Who We REJECT)
- **Early Stage:** <$5M ARR (unless hyper-growth).
- **Low-Tech:** Mom-and-pop shops, simple e-commerce.
- **Consulting Seekers:** Companies wanting "strategy decks" without implementation.
