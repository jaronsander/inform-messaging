## 1. The Strategy: "The Trojan Horse"

**The Concept:** Companies hiring for "RevOps Managers" or "CRM Admins" are in pain. They know their data is messy.
**The Pivot:** Do NOT apply for the job. Pitch the **"Pre-Hire Cleanup."**
**The Logic:** "Your new hire will spend 6 months cleaning this mess. Let me fix it in 3 weeks so they can actually drive strategy on day 1."

### Triggers & Keywords
Search Job Boards (LinkedIn, Indeed) for:
- "Clean up"
- "Migration" / "Implementation"
- "Data Hygiene"
- "Messy CRM"
- "Salesforce" / "HubSpot"

## 2. Outreach Templates

### Template A: The Direct Pivot (To Hiring Manager)
*Subject: Regarding the [Job Title] role (and the data mess)*

"Hi [Name],

I saw your post for a [Job Title]. It looks like you're dealing with some significant [mention pain point from JD: e.g., data hygiene/migration] debt.

I’m a Computer Engineer turned RevOps specialist. I’m not applying for the full-time role.

Instead, I help companies like yours clean up the technical mess **before** the new hire starts. I can run a 'Deep-Scan' Leak Detection on your database next week to identify the broken schemas and 'orphaned' leads causing your current friction.

This way, your new hire inherits a Ferrari, not a fix-it project.

Open to a 15-min forensic review of your current stack?

Best,
[Your Name]
The Funnel Plumber"

### Template B: The "Interview" Pivot
*Use when you are on a call that feels like an interview.*

**Client:** "Tell us about your background. Why do you want this job?"

**You:** "To be honest, [Name], I don't think I'm the employee you need right now. I think you need a 'Fixer.'

If you hire a manager now, they’ll spend their first 6 months drowning in the cleanup work you described.

My proposal: Let me come in as a tactical consultant for 3 weeks. I’ll perform the 'Deep Scan,' fix the routing logic, and hand you a clean stack. Then, you hire the manager to drive the car I just fixed. It’s faster, cheaper, and gets you immediate revenue."
