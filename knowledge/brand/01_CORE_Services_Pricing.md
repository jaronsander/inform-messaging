## 1. The Service Tiers (The "Industrial" Offer)

We don't sell "packages" or "hours." We sell **Revenue Recovery** and **Flow Assurance**.

### Tier 1: The "Deep-Scan" Leak Detection (Immediate ROI)
**The Hook:** "I’m going to send a camera down your pipes."
**What it is:** Forensic analysis of raw CRM data using Python/Pandas to find "orphaned" leads, broken syncs, and silent leakage.
**The Promise:** "I will find at least $50k in 'Orphaned' pipeline or you don't pay."
**Deliverables:**
1.  **Lost Revenue Manifest:** CSV of high-value leads stuck in "digital limbo."
2.  **The Leak Report:** Technical diagram of logic failures.
**Investment:** $4,000 - $8,000 (Fixed) | **Timeline:** 1-2 Weeks

### Tier 2: The Pipeline Re-Architecture (The Fix)
**The Hook:** "We are ripping out the rusted pipes and installing industrial PVC."
**What it is:** Moving complex logic out of brittle UI builders into robust systems. Refactoring the revenue stack.
**The Promise:** "A self-healing routing engine that ensures no lead is ever left behind."
**Deliverables:**
1.  **Speed-to-Lead Re-Pipe:** Automated routing logic (<5 mins latency).
2.  **"Dead Zone" Wake-Up:** Nurture sequences for "Lost" leads.
3.  **Single Source of Truth Schema:** Architected data model.
**Investment:** $12,000 - $30,000 (Project) | **Timeline:** 4-8 Weeks

### Tier 3: Flow Assurance & Telemetry (The Maintenance)
**The Hook:** "I watch the pressure gauges so you don't have to."
**What it is:** The "Observatory" layer. Ongoing monitoring, API management, and schema protection.
**The Promise:** "99.9% Uptime for your Revenue Engine."
**Deliverables:**
1.  **Monthly Throughput Reports:** Conversion rates & anomalies.
2.  **Data Hygiene Scripting:** Nightly automated sweeps.
3.  **Continuous Telemetry:** Real-time alerts.
**Investment:** $3,000 - $5,000/mo (Retainer) | **Timeline:** Ongoing

## 2. Value Proposition & ROI

### The Core Value Prop
**"We prevent the silent corruption of your revenue data so you can scale without compounding data debt."**

### ROI Proof Points (Use these to justify price)
- **Revenue Increase:** **32%** increase at Chief of Staff Network (intelligent routing).
- **Churn Reduction:** **40%** reduction at Revenue Accelerator (client visibility portal).
- **Cost Savings:** **75%** cost reduction at Sylva (consolidating 7 CRMs).
- **Scale:** Jaron has managed **4M+ contacts** across 7 major consolidations.

### The Cost of Bad Data (The "Why Now")
1.  **Manual Cleanup:** RevOps spends 20 hrs/month fixing data ($18k/yr wasted).
2.  **Lost Deals:** 1 lost deal/month due to bad data = $120k-$300k/yr.
3.  **Blocked AI:** You cannot deploy expensive AI tools on dirty data ("Garbage In, Garbage Out").

## 3. Delivery Philosophy
- **Engineers, not Marketers:** We build durable infrastructure, not campaigns.
- **Pattern Recognition:** Our "Observatory" rules are based on 4M+ contacts of data. We've seen the same 100 mistakes everywhere.
- **Platform-Agnostic Strategy:** We design the system architecture first, then select the right platform for your business. Primary implementation focus: HubSpot, Salesforce, Attio (for fastest deployment). Extensive experience across 15+ platforms ensures strategy isn't constrained by tool limitations.
- **Player-Coach Model:** Jaron owns the architecture; vetted team handles execution.
