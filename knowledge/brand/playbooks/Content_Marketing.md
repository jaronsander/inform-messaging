# PLAYBOOK: Content Engine

**Role:** The Funnel Plumber  
**Goal:** Create high-converting content that attracts our ICP.  
**Primary Channel:** LinkedIn  

---

## 1. Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Our Voice Is:**
- **Clinical:** Use precise, engineering terms (Latency, Throughput, Schema).
- **Authoritative:** You are the expert surgeon/engineer.
- **Urgent:** The leak is happening *now*.
- **Playful:** Technical authority with approachable charm. Serious about infrastructure, but we don't take ourselves too seriously. (The rubber hose animation style carries this balance.)
- **Conversational Structure:** Use short, punchy side commentary in brackets. (Like this.) Avoid long parenthetical sentences.

**We Are NOT:**
- **Cheerleaders:** No "Great things happening!" fluff.
- **Consultants:** No "Synergistic holistic paradigms."
- **Apologetic:** We don't say "maybe we can help." We say "we fix this."
- **Hype Chasers:** We choose tools that work (Toolbox), not just what's new (Toys). We prioritize infrastructure reliability over "shiny object" fatigue.
- **Sterile:** We're not another forgettable B2B brand. Our visuals have personality.

## 2. LinkedIn Strategy: The "Tri-Type" Mix

We alternate between three specific post types to build a complete funnel on LinkedIn.

### Type A: Personal Story (The "War Story")
*Purpose: Increase Engagement & Trust (EEAT)*
Connects the human element to the technical problem.
- **Focus:** Experience & Expertise. Share a specific time you faced a problem or learned a hard lesson.
- **Tone:** Vulnerable but authoritative ("I messed this up so you don't have to").
- **Example:** "In 2018, I wiped 50k leads because I didn't understand API rate limits. Here is the script I wrote to ensure it never happens again."

### Type B: Thought Leadership (The "Expert Opinion")
*Purpose: Education & Authority (EEAT)*
Establishes you as the "Surgeon" who understands the deep infrastructure.
- **Focus:** Authoritativeness. Challenge industry norms or explain complex concepts simply.
- **Tone:** Clinical, precise, contrarian.
- **Example:** (Theme B) "Stop hiring email copywriters when your domain reputation is trash. Fix the plumbing first."

### Type C: Sales Post (The "Direct Offer")
*Purpose: Sales (Conversion)*
Directly asks for the business based on a solved problem.
- **Focus:** Trustworthiness & Results.
- **Tone:** Direct, urgent, value-driven.
- **Example:** "I am looking for 3 CTOs who are tired of 'Ghost Leads'. I will audit your CRM for free this week. DM me 'FIX'."

## 3. Writing Frameworks

### Framework 1: PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)
*Best for: Sales & Thought Leadership Posts*
1.  **Problem:** State the pain point clearly. ("Your CRM is full of duplicates.")
2.  **Agitate:** Make it hurt. Quantify the cost. ("That's $30k/year in wasted rep time and 15% lower conversion rates.")
3.  **Solution:** Offer the fix. ("We wrote a Python script that deduplicates by fuzzy matching. It runs nightly. Problem solved.")

### Framework 2: EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)
*Best for: All Content (Google/Algo alignment)*
- **Experience:** "I have done this..." (First-hand accounts).
- **Expertise:** "Here is the technical reason why..." (Deep knowledge).
- **Authoritativeness:** "Industry standard is wrong because..." (Leader status).
- **Trust:** "Here is the data/proof..." (Reliability).

---

## 4. Core Content Themes (The "What")

### Theme A: "The Horror Story" (Pattern Recognition)
*Formula: "I saw this mistake [X] times across 4M contacts."*
- **Example:** "I was consolidating 7 CRMs. Found 'Company Name' in the 'Job Title' field. 11,000 records corrupted. Cost $10k to fix. This is why you need validation rules, not just training."

### Theme B: "The Decorator vs. The Plumber"
*Formula: Contrast popular superficial work with deep infrastructure work.*
- **Example:** "Everyone wants a pretty email template (Decoration). No one checks if the API sync failed (Plumbing). One looks nice. The other costs you $50k/month in lost leads."

### Theme C: "The Invisible Cost"
*Formula: Quantify the pain of doing nothing.*
- **Example:** "Your RevOps manager spends 15 hours/week merging duplicates. That's $30k/year in wasted salary. I can script that in Python in 4 hours. Stop doing manual labor."

---

## 5. Problem Language (Swipe File)
*Use these phrases to resonate with prospects.*
- "My CRM is a crime scene."
- "Sales and Marketing are fighting over attribution."
- "We have 'Ghost Leads' that no one touched."
- "I'm scared to touch the workflow because I might break it."
- "We are drowning in technical debt."

## 6. Visual Style Guidelines

**Core Style: 1930s Rubber Hose Animation**
All Inform Growth graphics use a vintage rubber hose cartoon aesthetic. This isn't nostalgia for nostalgia's sake—it's strategic differentiation. Every B2B SaaS company looks the same. We don't.

### Visual System: Infrastructure-Focused
All visuals are infrastructure-focused — pipes, valves, gauges, and tools. No mascot or recurring character.

**Visual Elements:**
- Infrastructure stickers (pipes, gauges, valves, wrenches, magnifying glasses)
- Problem indicators (rust orange corrosion, leaks, broken gauges)
- Solution indicators (clean pipes, green flow, healthy gauges)

### Graphic Types

**Data Flow Diagrams:**
- Bendy pipes connecting systems (CRM → Marketing Automation → Sales)
- Leaks visualized as cartoon drips with dollar signs
- Tools (wrenches, plungers) interacting with the flow
- Use brand colors: green for healthy flow, rust orange for intervention points

**Social Media Graphics:**
- Carbon gray backgrounds (dark mode native)
- Infrastructure stickers as focal point or supporting elements
- Bold ROI Green text for key stats/hooks
- Die-cut sticker aesthetic with white borders on elements

**Comparison Charts:**
- Before/After infrastructure transformations (tangled pipes → clean systems)
- Problem vs. solution visualized through pipe condition and gauge readings
- Rubber hose style applies to all illustrated elements

**Iconography:**
- All icons follow rubber hose aesthetic (bendy, playful, exaggerated)
- Tools: wrenches, plungers, pipes, gauges, data scrolls
- Avoid: flat/minimal icons, stock illustration styles

### Color Application

| Element | Color | Hex |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Backgrounds | Carbon Gray | `#2B2B2B` |
| Headlines/CTAs | ROI Green | `#39FF14` |
| Accents/Interactive | Rust Orange | `#D35400` |
| Body Text | Vintage Cream | `#F5F5DC` |
| Borders/Contrast | White | `#FFFFFF` |

### Carousel Structure: Optimal Length (5-12 Slides)
LinkedIn carousels perform best at 5-12 slides. Each swipe = engagement signal.

**Standard Structure:**
- **Slide 1 (The Hook):** Bold hypothesis or problem statement. Strong infrastructure visual (broken gauge, tangled pipes, or problem illustration).
- **Middle Slides (The Value):** High-contrast text explaining the insight, framework, or solution. Use ROI Green for key stats. Keep each slide to 1-2 sentences.
- **Final Slide (The Question):** Ask for debate/validation to drive 15+ word comments. Simple text layout with supporting infrastructure icon.

**Consumption Rate Matters:** A 5-slide carousel viewed completely outperforms a 12-slide carousel where users only see half. Design for full completion.

### AI Image Generation Prompt (Master Template)
Use this prompt structure for generating infrastructure assets:

> "[Subject] depicted as a die-cut vinyl sticker with a bold white border. 1930s rubber hose animation style. Industrial infrastructure. Flat vector, no gradients, no 3D. High contrast. Cyan (#00FFFF) background for chroma-key removal. No text on image."

See `.gemini/prompts/infrastructure_assets/README.md` for detailed generation rules and individual asset prompts.

### What to Avoid
- Stock photos (never)
- Generic B2B illustration styles (isometric people, flat design)
- Gradients or complex textures (keep it flat, bold, cartoon)
- Text, numbers, or labels on generated images (dollar signs $ OK)
- Overly busy compositions (6-8 elements max for illustrations, 3-4 for icons)

## 7. LinkedIn Algorithm Optimization (2025)

### Engagement Hierarchy (Algorithmic Weight)
LinkedIn ranks engagement signals by impact:
1. **Comments** (2x weight) — especially 15+ word comments (2.5x weight)
2. **Saves** (130% higher follow rate, strong reach signal)
3. **Reposts** (instant reposts = strongest reach driver)
4. **Shares** (strong signal, but less than saves/reposts)
5. **Reactions** (weakest signal, but still valuable)

**Implication:** Optimize every post to drive **comments** and **saves**, not just likes.

### How to Optimize for Comments
- **Ask genuine questions** (not engagement bait like "Comment YES if you agree")
- **Create controversy/debate** (take a strong stance, ask if you're wrong)
- **Make it personal** (share war stories, vulnerable insights)
- **Respond within 30 minutes** (increases comments by 64%)
- **Reply with 15+ words** (signals deeper engagement, boosts algorithm)
- **Ask follow-up questions** in replies (keep threads going)

**Example:** "Am I in my own bubble, or do you agree that RevOps > Marketing?" (drives debate)

### How to Optimize for Saves
Create **reference material** worth revisiting:
- Frameworks (step-by-step processes)
- Templates (swipe files, scripts)
- How-tos (tactical guides)
- Checklists (operational tools)
- Data/stats compilations (proof point libraries)

Only ~3% of posts get saved. Make yours worthy of a bookmark.

### The Golden Hour Protocol (First 60-90 Minutes)
The algorithm shows your post to a small test audience first. Strong engagement in the first hour triggers expanded distribution.

**Immediate Actions (0-5 min after publishing):**
1. Engage with 5-10 other posts (like + comment 15+ words) — signals reciprocal community participation
2. DM 3-5 highly engaged connections ("Just posted X—curious what you think")

**First 30 Minutes:**
3. Respond to every comment within 30 min (64% more comments, 2.3x more views)
4. Make responses 15+ words (algorithmic boost)
5. Ask follow-up questions (keep threads alive)

**Target:** 10+ comments in first hour to trigger expanded distribution to 2nd/3rd-degree connections.

### Negative Signals to Avoid
These hurt your reach:
- **Engagement bait** ("Comment YES if you agree!") — detected and devalued
- **External links** in post body (25-40% reach penalty) — put in comments if needed
- **>5 hashtags** (spam penalty) — optimal is 3 or fewer
- **AI-generated content** (30% less reach, 55% less engagement) — write authentically
- **Posting too frequently** (<12-18 hours between posts triggers AuthorRecentActivity penalty)

### Format Performance Data (2025)

| Format | Reach Multiplier | Best Use Case |
|--------|------------------|---------------|
| **Polls** | 1.64x | Quick validation, audience research (run for 7 days, not 1) |
| **Carousels** | 1.45x | Education, frameworks, thought leadership (5-12 slides optimal) |
| **Images** | 1.18x | Infographics (2.4x > stock photos), personal photos, diagrams |
| **Native Video** | 1.10x | Authenticity, demos (vertical, 1-2 min, subtitles, hook in 3 sec) |
| **Text Only** | 0.88x | Long-form insights (800-1000 chars for dwell time optimization) |
| **External Links** | -25-40% | Avoid in post body; use sparingly in comments |

**Mobile-First:** 72% of engagement happens on mobile. Design for vertical scroll, high contrast, touch-friendly sizing.

### Topic Authority Strategy
LinkedIn identifies you as a subject matter expert based on consistent posting about 2-4 niche topics.

**Your Core Topics:**
1. Revenue Operations Infrastructure
2. Data Debt & Funnel Plumbing
3. Sales Process Optimization
4. AI-Ready Data / Observability

**Consistency = Authority:** Post regularly about these topics to build expertise-driven ranking (up to 43% distribution boost).

**Profile Optimization:** Skills, endorsements from credible sources boost content distribution by up to 43%. Keep your profile aligned with your content topics.

### Posting Times & Cadence (Quick Reference)
- **Optimal frequency:** ≥12-18 hours between posts (quality > quantity)
- **Peak times:** Tuesday-Thursday, 8-10 AM or 5-7 PM in audience's timezone
- **Content lifespan:** High-quality content can surface for 2-3 weeks after posting
- **Followed account advantage:** Posts from followed accounts get priority (build your follower base)
