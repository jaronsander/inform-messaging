# PLAYBOOK: Content Engine

**Role:** The Funnel Plumber  
**Goal:** Create high-converting content that attracts our ICP.  
**Primary Channel:** LinkedIn  

---

## 1. Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Our Voice Is:**
- **Clinical:** Use precise, engineering terms (Latency, Throughput, Schema).
- **Authoritative:** You are the expert surgeon/engineer.
- **Urgent:** The leak is happening *now*.
- **Conversational Structure:** Use short, punchy side commentary in brackets. (Like this.) Avoid long parenthetical sentences.

**We Are NOT:**
- **Cheerleaders:** No "Great things happening!" fluff.
- **Consultants:** No "Synergistic holistic paradigms."
- **Apologetic:** We don't say "maybe we can help." We say "we fix this."
- **Hype Chasers:** We choose tools that work (Toolbox), not just what's new (Toys). We prioritize infrastructure reliability over "shiny object" fatigue.

## 2. LinkedIn Strategy: The "Tri-Type" Mix

We alternate between three specific post types to build a complete funnel on LinkedIn.

### Type A: Personal Story (The "War Story")
*Purpose: Increase Engagement & Trust (EEAT)*
Connects the human element to the technical problem.
- **Focus:** Experience & Expertise. Share a specific time you faced a problem or learned a hard lesson.
- **Tone:** Vulnerable but authoritative ("I messed this up so you don't have to").
- **Example:** "In 2018, I wiped 50k leads because I didn't understand API rate limits. Here is the script I wrote to ensure it never happens again."

### Type B: Thought Leadership (The "Expert Opinion")
*Purpose: Education & Authority (EEAT)*
Establishes you as the "Surgeon" who understands the deep infrastructure.
- **Focus:** Authoritativeness. Challenge industry norms or explain complex concepts simply.
- **Tone:** Clinical, precise, contrarian.
- **Example:** (Theme B) "Stop hiring email copywriters when your domain reputation is trash. Fix the plumbing first."

### Type C: Sales Post (The "Direct Offer")
*Purpose: Sales (Conversion)*
Directly asks for the business based on a solved problem.
- **Focus:** Trustworthiness & Results.
- **Tone:** Direct, urgent, value-driven.
- **Example:** "I am looking for 3 CTOs who are tired of 'Ghost Leads'. I will audit your CRM for free this week. DM me 'FIX'."

## 3. Writing Frameworks

### Framework 1: PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)
*Best for: Sales & Thought Leadership Posts*
1.  **Problem:** State the pain point clearly. ("Your CRM is full of duplicates.")
2.  **Agitate:** Make it hurt. Quantify the cost. ("That's $30k/year in wasted rep time and 15% lower conversion rates.")
3.  **Solution:** Offer the fix. ("We wrote a Python script that deduplicates by fuzzy matching. It runs nightly. Problem solved.")

### Framework 2: EEAT (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust)
*Best for: All Content (Google/Algo alignment)*
- **Experience:** "I have done this..." (First-hand accounts).
- **Expertise:** "Here is the technical reason why..." (Deep knowledge).
- **Authoritativeness:** "Industry standard is wrong because..." (Leader status).
- **Trust:** "Here is the data/proof..." (Reliability).

## 4. Core Content Themes (The "What")

### Theme A: "The Horror Story" (Pattern Recognition)
*Formula: "I saw this mistake [X] times across 4M contacts."*
- **Example:** "I was consolidating 7 CRMs. Found 'Company Name' in the 'Job Title' field. 11,000 records corrupted. Cost $10k to fix. This is why you need validation rules, not just training."

### Theme B: "The Decorator vs. The Plumber"
*Formula: Contrast popular superficial work with deep infrastructure work.*
- **Example:** "Everyone wants a pretty email template (Decoration). No one checks if the API sync failed (Plumbing). One looks nice. The other costs you $50k/month in lost leads."

### Theme C: "The Invisible Cost"
*Formula: Quantify the pain of doing nothing.*
- **Example:** "Your RevOps manager spends 15 hours/week merging duplicates. That's $30k/year in wasted salary. I can script that in Python in 4 hours. Stop doing manual labor."

## 5. Problem Language (Swipe File)
*Use these phrases to resonate with prospects.*
- "My CRM is a crime scene."
- "Sales and Marketing are fighting over attribution."
- "We have 'Ghost Leads' that no one touched."
- "I'm scared to touch the workflow because I might break it."
- "We are drowning in technical debt."
