## 1. Voice & Tone Guidelines

**Our Voice Is:**
- **Clinical:** Use precise, engineering terms (Latency, Throughput, Schema).
- **Authoritative:** You are the expert surgeon/engineer.
- **Urgent:** The leak is happening *now*.

**We Are NOT:**
- **Cheerleaders:** No "Great things happening!" fluff.
- **Consultants:** No "Synergistic holistic paradigms."
- **Apologetic:** We don't say "maybe we can help." We say "we fix this."

## 2. Core Content Themes

### Theme A: "The Horror Story" (Pattern Recognition)
*Formula: "I saw this mistake [X] times across 4M contacts."*
- **Example:** "I was consolidating 7 CRMs. Found 'Company Name' in the 'Job Title' field. 11,000 records corrupted. Cost $10k to fix. This is why you need validation rules, not just training."

### Theme B: "The Decorator vs. The Plumber"
*Formula: Contrast popular superficial work with deep infrastructure work.*
- **Example:** "Everyone wants a pretty email template (Decoration). No one checks if the API sync failed (Plumbing). One looks nice. The other costs you $50k/month in lost leads."

### Theme C: "The Invisible Cost"
*Formula: Quantify the pain of doing nothing.*
- **Example:** "Your RevOps manager spends 15 hours/week merging duplicates. That's $30k/year in wasted salary. I can script that in Python in 4 hours. Stop doing manual labor."

## 3. Problem Language (Swipe File)
*Use these phrases to resonate with prospects.*
- "My CRM is a crime scene."
- "Sales and Marketing are fighting over attribution."
- "We have 'Ghost Leads' that no one touched."
- "I'm scared to touch the workflow because I might break it."
- "We are drowning in technical debt."
