# PLAYBOOK: LinkedIn Comment Strategy

**Role:** The Funnel Plumber  
**Goal:** Demonstrate authority, add depth to the original post, and transition high-value interactions to DMs.  
**Rule:** Never just say "Thanks!" — Every comment is an opportunity to enforce the brand.

## 1. General Guidelines

- **Speed Matters:** The "Golden Hour" (first 60 mins) is critical for algorithm spread.
- **Don't Be a Cheerleader:** Avoid "Great point!", "Totally agree!", "100%!". It dilutes authority.
- **Add Value:** Every reply should add a new data point, a clarification, or a counter-perspective.
- **Move to DM:** If a comment gets too technical or specific to their company, take it offline immediately.

## 2. Tone & Style Constraints (User Preferences)

- **Extreme Brevity:** Cut the fluff. If it can be said in 2 sentences, don't use 4.
- **Anti-Salesy:** Never "pitch." Analyze the *architecture* of the problem. Don't sell the fix; diagnose the break.
- **Engineering Metaphors:** Frame business problems as technical failures.
    - *Good:* "This is a queuing architecture failure." / "Automation on a broken schema is a corruption accelerator."
    - *Bad:* "You need to align your sales and marketing teams."
- **Clinical Delivery:** State the diagnosis coldly. No softening language.

## 2. Response Frameworks by Comment Type

### Type A: The Fan (Praise)
*Context: "Great post!", "Love this."*
- **Mistake:** "Thanks, [Name]!"
- **The Plumber Strategy:** Acknowledge + Extend the logic.
- **Template:** "Glad it resonated, [Name]. This specific issue [mention detail] is usually the most expensive part of the leak."
- **Example:**
    - *Comment:* "So true. Data hygiene is key."
    - *Reply:* "Crucial, [Name]. Without it, your automation is just scaling chaos at high speed."

### Type B: The Seeker (Questions)
*Context: "How do you handle X?", "Does this work for HubSpot?"*
- **Mistake:** Giving a free consulting session in the comments.
- **The Plumber Strategy:** Give a clinical "What" and "Why", but save the "How" for a call/DM.
- **Template:** "Yes, [System] handles this, but you need to watch out for [Risk]. The schema is different."
- **Example:**
    - *Comment:* "Does this work with Salesforce?"
    - *Reply:* "It does, but Salesforce validation rules can conflict with this script if you aren't careful with the API user permissions. I can send you the documentation on that if you need it."

### Type C: The Skeptic (Disagreement)
*Context: "I think manual review is better.", "This seems dangerous."*
- **Mistake:** Getting defensive or arguing emotionally.
- **The Plumber Strategy:** Validate the risk (you are a safety expert, after all), then re-assert the efficiency with data.
- **Template:** "That is a fair concern for small datasets (<5k records). But at 500k records, manual review fails due to human fatigue errors. Automation is the only way to scale safety."

### Type D: The Lead (Sales Signal)
*Context: "We are drowning in this right now.", "I need this."*
- **Mistake:** "Let's book a call! [Calendar Link]" (Too aggressive publicly).
- **The Plumber Strategy:** Validate the pain -> Pivot to DM.
- **Template:** "Sounds like a standard 'Ghost Lead' issue. I'll shoot you a DM, let's see if we can plug that leak."

## 3. The "Value-Add" Swipe File
*Short, punchy additions to tag onto replies.*

- "Speed is irrelevant if the direction is wrong."
- "Clean data is the only competitive advantage left."
- "Don't automate a broken process."
- "Latency kills conversion."
- "Validation rules > User training."
