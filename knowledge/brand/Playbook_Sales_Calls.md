## 1. The Script Framework

### Phase 1: The Diagnosis (Listen & Agitate)
*Ask questions to reveal "Data Debt."*
- "Who is monitoring your data quality right now?"
- "When was the last time you found a lead that had been sitting untouched for weeks?"
- "You're hiring 3 new reps. How are you ensuring they don't corrupt the data your current team uses?"

### Phase 2: The Reframe (The "Funnel Plumber" Pitch)
*Move them from 'Marketing' to 'Engineering'.*
- **them:** "We need better dashboards."
- **You:** "Dashboards are rear-view mirrors. They show you what already broke. You need **telemetry**—alarms that go off *before* the revenue is lost."
- **Them:** "We need a cleanup."
- **You:** "Cleanups are temporary. Entropy is permanent. I don't just clean; I install 'filters' to keep the water clean forever."

### Phase 3: The Offer (The Tiers)
- **Tier 1 (Deep Scan):** "Let's start with a forensic audit. I'll find $50k in lost pipeline in 2 weeks or you don't pay."
- **Tier 2 (The Fix):** "Then I'll rip out the bad piping and install automated routing."
- **Tier 3 (Maintenance):** "Then I stay on to watch the gauges so you never have to do this again."

## 2. Objection Handling (Battle Cards)

### "We already have a HubSpot Agency."
**Response:** "That’s great. They are the 'decorators'—they make the emails look nice. I am the 'plumber'—I make sure the pipes (APIs/Data) actually deliver the water to the right place. You need both, but pretty emails don't matter if the data doesn't arrive."

### "This sounds expensive."
**Response:** "Leakage is expensive. My 'Deep Scan' usually uncovers 10x my fee in lost pipeline in the first week. You aren't paying for 'hours'; you are paying for 'revenue recovery'."

### "Can't we just hire a RevOps manager?"
**Response:** "You should! But do you want them spending $120k/year cleaning up duplicates manually? Let me fix the infrastructure first. Then hire them to do high-value strategy, not janitorial work."

### "We're not ready yet / Talk in Q2."
**Response:** "Data debt compounds like interest. What costs $5k to fix today will cost $25k in Q2 because your new hires will have multiplied the errors. Let's just do the Deep Scan now so you know what you're up against."
