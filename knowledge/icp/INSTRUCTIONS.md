# Protocol: ICP Management

**Purpose:** This document outlines how to maintain and update the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP).

## 1. Updating the ICP
*   **When to Update:**
    *   When we successfully serve a new type of client (e.g., expanding from SaaS to Service Businesses).
    *   When we identify a new "Red Flag" or Anti-ICP trait.
*   **How to Update:**
    *   Modify `00_ICP_Definition.md`.
    *   Ensure the changes are reflected in `knowledge/brand/Playbook_Prospecting.md` (Qualification Checklist).

## 2. ICP Verification
*   **Before Engagement:** Check prospects against the `Must-Haves` and `Red Flags` in `knowledge/brand/Playbook_Prospecting.md`.
*   **During Engagement:** Note any friction points that might indicate a bad fit (e.g., client size too small, tech stack too simple).
