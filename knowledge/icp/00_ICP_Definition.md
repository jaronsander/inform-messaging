# ICP Definition: Who We Serve

**Purpose:** To clearly define our target market and who we avoid.
**Use In:** Prospect qualification and marketing targeting.

## 🎯 Primary ICP: Scaling B2B SaaS & Service Businesses

### Firmographics
*   **Company Stage:**
    *   **B2B SaaS:** Series B, C, or growth-stage ($5M+ ARR).
    *   **Tech-Enabled Service Businesses:** High-volume, tech-enabled services (Series B+ equivalent). Especially those with:
        *   Services arm attached to SaaS subscriptions (hybrid model)
        *   Platform/software component alongside service delivery
        *   Upsell motion from services to recurring subscriptions
        *   Digital communities with membership + services
*   **Revenue Model:** B2B SaaS, Platform + Services hybrid, or High-Volume Service with subscription components.
*   **Contract Value:** $25K-500K+ ACV.
*   **Sales Cycle:** 60-180 days.
*   **Employees:** 50-300 employees.
*   **Growth:** Growing 40-100%+ YoY.
*   **Tech Stack:** Agnostic but advanced. Typically Salesforce, HubSpot, or Attio. Often using 10+ SaaS tools in their GTM stack (Outreach, Salesloft, Gong, 6sense, ZoomInfo).

### Budget & Maturity Indicators
*   **Roles:** Presence of "VP of RevOps," "Head of Operations," or "Salesforce Administrator" (implies they value infrastructure).
*   **Tech Spend:** Usage of expensive tier tools (Salesforce, HubSpot Enterprise, Clari, 6sense).
*   **Pain Signal:** High headcount in data-entry roles or "Sales Ops" performing manual tasks.

### Psychographics (Buying Signals)
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   "Drowning in **manual entry**."
    *   "Cannot **maintain hygiene** across large datasets."
    *   "Sales reps wasting 20% of time on admin/cleanup."
    *   "Data silos between 'Service Delivery' and 'Sales'."
    *   "I can't trust our pipeline reports."
    *   "We just paid for a cleanup and it's degrading again."
*   **Goals:**
    *   Wants to deploy AI/automation but data is too messy.
    *   Needs to prepare for a fundraise or exit (data room prep).

## 🚫 Anti-ICP: Who We DO NOT Serve

1.  **Early-Stage Companies (<$5M ARR)**
    *   **Why:** Too early for the complexity we solve. ROI isn't there yet.
    *   **Exception:** Hyper-growth startups (100+ employees, Series B+ at $3-4M ARR).

2.  **Low-Tech / Traditional Small Business**
    *   **Why:** Simple tools (spreadsheets) don't have the "plumbing" problems we solve.
    *   **Examples:** Local businesses, simple e-commerce, traditional manufacturing.

3.  **Consulting Seekers**
    *   **Why:** We are engineers, not strategy consultants. We build systems.
    *   **Signal:** "Can you just tell us what to do and we'll build it ourselves?"

4.  **Custom App Development**
    *   **Why:** We are infrastructure engineers, not a dev shop.
    *   **Signal:** "We need a custom Stripe integration" or "Can you build us a tool?"
