## 🚫 Anti-ICP: Who We DO NOT Serve

1.  **Early-Stage Companies (<$5M ARR)**
    *   **Why:** Too early for the complexity we solve. ROI isn't there yet.
    *   **Exception:** Hyper-growth startups (100+ employees, Series B+ at $3-4M ARR).

2.  **Low-Tech / Traditional Small Business**
    *   **Why:** Simple tools (spreadsheets) don't have the "plumbing" problems we solve.
    *   **Examples:** Local businesses, simple e-commerce, traditional manufacturing.

3.  **Consulting Seekers**
    *   **Why:** We are engineers, not strategy consultants. We build systems.
    *   **Signal:** "Can you just tell us what to do and we'll build it ourselves?"

4.  **Custom App Development**
    *   **Why:** We are infrastructure engineers, not a dev shop.
    *   **Signal:** "We need a custom Stripe integration" or "Can you build us a tool?"
