# Case Study: The "Ghosting Cure" (Chief of Staff Network)

**Subject:** Chief of Staff Network (Education & Cohorts)  
**Theme:** Lead Volume vs. Human Capacity  
**The Hook:** "How we used logic to interview 50% fewer people but make 32% more money."

## 1. The Context (The "Before")
**The Client:** A selective professional network and course provider.
**The Environment:** High demand, limited cohorts, manual application review process.

**The Friction:**
*   **The Bottleneck:** The team was manually interviewing every applicant to determine fit.
*   **The "Ghosting":** Because the team was overwhelmed, qualified leads sat in the inbox for days. By the time they were contacted, they had lost interest.
*   **Subjectivity:** "Fit" was determined by gut feeling rather than data.

## 2. The "Plumbing" (The Fix)
**Strategy:** Implement "Logic-Based Routing" to remove humans from the sorting process.
**The Stack:** Application Form (Typeform/Gravity Forms), Automation Layer (Zapier/Make), CRM.

**The Execution:**
1.  **The Audit:** Analyzed past successful students to identify key attributes (Title, Company Size, Years of Experience).
2.  **The Logic Buckets:**
    *   *Bucket A (Auto-Accept):* Meets all criteria. **Action:** Send payment link immediately.
    *   *Bucket B (Interview):* Borderline cases. **Action:** Send calendar link for 15-min vet.
    *   *Bucket C (Auto-Reject):* Does not meet criteria. **Action:** Send polite rejection + free resource link (nurture).
3.  **The "Payment Defense":** Automated follow-ups for Bucket A until payment was complete or objection was raised.

## 3. The "Flow" (Results & ROI)
*   **Efficiency:** Reduced interview volume by **50%**. The team only spoke to people who actually needed vetting.
*   **Revenue Velocity:** Increased revenue by **32%** in one month. Why? Because "Bucket A" prospects could pay immediately while their intent was high, instead of waiting a week for an interview.
*   **Student Experience:** Faster answers for everyone, creating a premium brand feel.
