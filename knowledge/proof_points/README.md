# Case Studies & Proof Points

**Purpose:** This directory contains the "evidence" that powers our brand.
**Usage:** Reference these files when handling objections ("Have you done this before?"), writing social content, or building proposals.

## Structure
*   **`00_ROI_Master_Sheet.md`**: The high-level stats and "Hook" one-liners.
*   **`case_studies/`**: Detailed breakdowns of specific client engagements.

## How to Ingest New Case Studies
1.  **Extract the Core Metrics:** (e.g., "30% churn reduction"). Add this to the ROI Master Sheet.
2.  **Identify the "Hook":** (e.g., "We turned 3M messy rows into a sellable asset").
3.  **Write the Deep Dive:** Create a new file in `case_studies/` (e.g., `Agency_Data_Lake.md`) following the "Problem -> Plumbing -> Flow" format.
